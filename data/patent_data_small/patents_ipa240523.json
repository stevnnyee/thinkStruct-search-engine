A balance ring is typically mounted between two vehicle wheels in a dual wheel arrangement, or between the axle hub and the vehicle wheel in a single wheel arrangement. Attaching additional components to the hub of the vehicle wheel increases the number of interfaces in the clamped joint at the hub, which can increase the potential for joint loosening. Also, attaching both aerodynamic cover and balance ring components to the hub can increase the mass of the vehicle wheel assembly.
