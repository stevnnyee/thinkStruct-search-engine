In the embodiments shown, the bassinet comprises a base, a column assembly connected to the base, an arm connected to the column assembly, a tub frame connected to the arm, and an infant tub that is removably contained within the tub frame. In some embodiments, the height of the arm, the tub frame, and the infant tub is variable and manually selectable by a user, from a standing or seated position for example, over a predefined range of heights relative to the base and the surface on which the mobile bassinet is supported (e.g., the floor). In some embodiments, the arm is a rotary arm that is configured to rotate through a predefined range of rotary movements relative to the base of the mobile bassinet. In some embodiments, the tub frame is configured to rotate relative to the arm. In some embodiments, the base may be absent and replaced with another structure, such as any suitable non-movable structure for example, that provides complete support for the bassinet, such as, for example, a hospital bed in a postnatal unit room in a hospital or other birthing center, such that the bassinet is no longer independently mobile from the supporting structure, but is rotatable relative thereto. These features are capable of being combined in any combination without deviating from the scope of the subject matter disclosed herein.", "", "InFIGS.1and2, an example embodiment of a mobile bassinet, generally designated1, is shown. Bassinet1has a base, generally designated100, a column assembly, generally designated200, attached to the base100, an arm, generally designated300, rotatably connected to the column assembly200, a tub frame, generally designated400, rotatably connected to the arm, and an infant tub, generally designated500, that is removably contained within a recessed portion of the tub frame400. As shown, the tub frame has, for example, three rotational degrees of freedom from a stationary object (e.g., a hospital bed) about which the bassinet1is movably positioned. The first rotational degree of freedom is achieved by the base100being rotatable and/or pivotable relative to the stationary object using, for example casters (see, e.g.,130inFIG.3). The second rotational degree of freedom is achieved by the column assembly200, as well as the arm300, tub frame400, and infant tub500, being rotatable and/or pivotable about the base100. The third rotational degree of freedom is achieved by the tub frame400, as well as the infant tub500, being rotatable and/or pivotable about the arm300. At least some of the components of the bassinet1are capable of being secured and/or locked, at least temporarily, in any respective position achieved due to the three rotational degrees of freedom. Due to these three rotational degrees of freedom, the infant tub is capable of being moved into virtually any user-selectable position relative to the stationary object. InFIG.2, the bassinet1is shown in a position and configuration that could be used for either transport of an infant within the infant tub500or for inactive periods of time (e.g., when the infant is sleeping).", "", "FIG.3shows an isometric view of the base100isolated from the other components of bassinet1. Base100comprises a main body, generally designated110, which comprises a base plate112and a wheel mount area116attached at each corner thereof, with the wheel mount areas116being connected to the base plate112by a transition region114. The use of the transition regions114allows for the base100to have a lower center of mass by having the base plate112lower than the height of the wheel mount areas116, which is generally determined by the physical dimensions of the wheels130selected for a given application. By way of example, it may be advantageous to use caster or other wheels130that are pneumatic for bassinets that will be used to transport infants over any typical surfaces (e.g., paved surfaces), while harder wheels130, e.g., those made from plastic or solid rubber, may be selected for bassinets that will only be used on smooth surfaces, such as those found within a typical U.S. hospital. In general, pneumatic wheels will have a larger diameter than will hard plastic or rubber caster wheels, such that the height difference between the wheel mount area116and the base plate112may be selected based on the type of wheel130that will be installed on the base100of the bassinet. Base100can include manual or front wheels134which can be manually lockable (e.g., by foot actuation of a locking lever) and are rotatable in direction R1about an axis. Base100also has rear wheels132which can have an automatic locking function, such that they will only rotate when the automatic lock is released by a user and will automatically lock when the user disengages the automatic lock release or the base can instead be otherwise secured without automatic locking into a stationary position with any suitable structure. Also, it is possible for base100to not have any locking function. Rear wheels132can be pivoting, as shown by R1for front wheels134, or can be rotationally fixed. In the embodiment shown, all caster wheels130are rotatable in the direction R1about an axis defined by the attachment location of each caster wheel130to the base100. Each wheel130can be individually locked in a stationary position, for example angularly or rotationally, to prevent movement thereof while the bassinet is in motion. Each wheel130can also include a shroud or other cover if desired. Base100has a hole120therein for attachment of the column assembly200to the base100.", "", "InFIG.4, an internal view of column assembly200is shown, with external structural/cladding members being omitted to clearly illustrate the internal structures therein. Column support250is attached to the base100(seeFIG.3) of the bassinet and is fixed thereto such that the column support250is held stationary with respect to base100. A height adjuster252is attached to the base100at a first end thereof and to a support post230at a second end thereof. The height adjuster252allows for arm300to be set at one of a plurality of heights relative to base100within a predefined range of height values. The support post230is connected at its first end to the arm300by arm collar320, which is securely clamped about the support post230to prevent relative angular rotations between the arm300and the support post230. The support post230passes through a linear bearing, generally designated210. The linear bearing is configured to prevent relative rotational movements between the support post230, which has a square cross-section and a circular lower support member236(seeFIG.10). The support post230has a support post positioner generally designated240attached at the second end thereof. The support post positioner240has a cross-sectional shape that is contoured to the inner surface of the lower support member236. Because the support post230is connected to the lower support member236at two positions, unwanted movements (e.g., \u201cwobbling\u201d) of the infant tub are minimized. The support post230is moved vertically by an actuation of the height adjuster, which can be a pneumatic cylinder in some embodiments.", "", "The linear bearing210is shown in greater detail inFIGS.5-8. The linear bearing210has a housing212that can be formed as a single piece with a single housing seam214or as two separate pieces that are attached (e.g., hinged together in a clam shell arrangement or as separate pieces that are not connected to each other prior to installation) around the support post230, so as to define two housing seams214. The housing212has an upper flange211with a shape that is substantially similar (e.g., a same, similar, or larger diameter) to the lower support member236(seeFIG.10). The housing212is connected to the lower support member236by fasteners222(e.g., threaded screws) passing through holes222A passing through the flange211. At least one (e.g., a plurality of) upper roller218extends upwards from the housing212and is arranged on each of the lateral sides of the support post230. At least one (e.g., a plurality of) lower roller220extends downwards from the housing212and is arranged on each of the lateral sides of the support post230. Upper and lower rollers218and220, respectively, are attached to the housing212at support members218A and220A, respectively, which have through-holes formed therethrough. Upper and lower rollers218and220, respectively, can be made of a material having a suitable durometer so as to be at least partially compressed against the surface of the support post230to ensure positive pressure in the attachment of the linear bearing210about the support post230. Linear bearing210is secured about the support post230by one or more clamping fasteners216, which can be of the threaded screw type. The linear bearing210is configured such that the support post230is vertically mobile through and relative to the linear bearing210. A cavity224is formed through the thickness (e.g., in the vertical direction) of the linear bearing210. The cavity224has a cross-sectional shape and contour that is at least as large as the cross-sectional shape of the support post230, but preferably has a larger cross-sectional area than the support post230.", "", "FIG.7shows the support post positioner240, which has a perimeter in the shape of a cylindrical disc, which is substantially the same shape as the inner surface of the lower support member236(seeFIG.10), which is shown in this embodiment in the form of a hollow cylindrical member. The support post positioner240has or defines a recess242that has a shape (e.g., a \u201cfootprint\u201d) that is the same size as the second end of the support post230(seeFIG.4) where it is connected thereto. The outer and inner perimeters of the recess242are shaped such that a distance therebetween is at least as large as the thickness of the outer walls of the support post230. The support post positioner240is secured, in the embodiment shown, to the support post230by passing a threaded member through and from each of the securing holes, generally designated246, into threaded receivers, generally designated247on at least two opposing sides of the support post positioner240. The support post positioner240has at least one or more cable-guiding holes, generally designated244, that are formed through a thickness of the support post positioner240. In the embodiment shown, a plurality of (e.g., four) cable-guiding holes244are provided and pass from an upper surface to a lower surface within a central portion of the support post positioner240. These cable-guiding holes244are inclined at an angle relative to a vertical axis substantially parallel to the direction of extension of the support post230. This inclination of the cable-guiding holes244may have a radial inclination component to impart a curvature or winding form to the actuation cables passing therethrough (seeFIG.21) so that these cables may be held in a coiled configuration within the lower support member236. A central void, generally designated248, is formed and is configured such that the height adjuster252(seeFIG.10) can pass therethrough to be secured to the support post230. In some embodiments, a hole may be formed through the height adjuster252that would be aligned to the securing holes246for securing the height adjuster to the support post230. In such embodiments, the receivers247may not be threaded so that a connecting rod may freely extend therethrough to interconnect the support post230, the support post positioner240, and the height adjuster252.", "", "The height adjuster252is shown inFIG.9as fixedly connected to a rotary gear260, such that they are rotationally locked together, e.g., by threaded members. The rotary gear260has a predefined range of rotary movement defined by a toothed region262(seeFIG.12). In the embodiment shown, the rotary gear260has a maximum range of motion of \u00b1135\u00b0 from a nominal (i.e. \u201c0\u00b0\u201d) position. The column assembly200is secured to the base by collar280, which is attached to the base100(e.g., at hole120, seeFIG.3) in the form of a sandwich member, having a two-piece construction with a first piece positioned below the base100and a second piece positioned above the base100. Collar280may be in the form of a rotary bearing for smooth rotary movements of the column assembly200relative to the base100. In some embodiments, a bearing may be provided separately from the collar280.

Anti-tip safety arm290is shown in the rotated, deployed, position, and is aligned to move radially with arm300, such that arm300and anti-tip safety arm290are aligned in a common plane.", "", "FIGS.11-15show the anti-tip safety arm290in the retracted and deployed positions. InFIG.11, the anti-tip safety arm290is arranged in the retracted position. Anti-tip safety arm290can comprise an anti-skid footing298at a distal end thereof, which can be made of, for example, rubber or any material of sufficient durometer. Anti-tip safety arm290is rotatably locked to move along with rotational movements of the column assembly by being secured to anti-tip safety arm mount292at a proximal end of anti-tip safety arm290. Anti-tip safety arm290also has actuating member294attached adjacent to the proximal end of anti-tip safety arm290. Actuating disc296is provided in the form of an arc on a bottom surface of base100and actuating member294is positioned on anti-tip safety arm290to interface with actuating disc. Actuating disc has a reduced height at the central position, such that anti-tip safety arm290, which is spring-biased in the upward direction (e.g., towards the base100), is moved to the retracted position when the actuating member294is located within the reduced height region of the actuating disc. Similarly, when the column assembly200and anti-tip safety arm290are rotated from the nominal position, the actuating member294rotates and is displaced vertically downwards by the increased thickness of the actuating disc296away from the nominal position. In the embodiment shown, the actuating disc296has rotational stop elements296A positioned at the extremes of the arc defined by the actuating disc296to prevent excess movement of anti-tip safety arm290beyond the bounds of the safety disc. In some embodiments, the rotational stop elements296A can be used to define the maximum amount of rotation of the column assembly200and arm300to prevent excessive rotation thereof relative to the base100. The angular position of the column assembly200and the arm300is maintained by engagement of the rotary lock270with the toothed portion262of the rotary gear260. The rotary lock270is slidingly attached to the base100at slot111(seeFIG.10). By slidingly actuating rotary lock270to move radially away from the rotary gear260, it is possible to rotate column assembly200and arm300relative to base100. Once rotary lock270is slidingly reengaged with the toothed portion262of rotary gear260, relative angular movements between the base100and the column assembly200are prevented. Rotary lock270and the rotary gear260have interlocking gear teeth formed therein that are complementary (e.g., having a shape and size that mesh together). The granularity of rotational movement of the column assembly200relative to the base100is determined by the size and pitch of the gear teeth of the rotary gear260and the rotary lock270.FIGS.14and15are exploded views of the components of the column assembly200that engage with and enable rotational movement relative to the base100.", "", "FIGS.16and17show the wheel handles, generally designated410, that are attached to the tub frame400.

This location of the pivot/rotation handles is contemplated as being advantageous because it will be more easily accessible by mobility-impaired users, such as, for example, new mothers. Located underneath the grip432is one or more actuation bars434that a user can linearly actuate by pulling the actuation bar434towards the perimeter edge of the grip432while holding grip432. The actuation bar434, when actuated, allows for the column assembly200and the arm300to rotate relative to the base100, while simultaneously allowing for the tub frame400and the infant tub500to rotate and/or pivot about the substantially circular hub310of arm300. In this embodiment collar250does not rotate with respect to base100, but is instead rigidly attached thereto, so that lower support member236rotated within the collar250. In the embodiment shown, pivot/rotation handles430have a single stage actuation, such that the rotating movement of arm300and column assembly200and the pivoting movement of tub frame400and infant tub500are activated substantially simultaneously.

The opposite is also true, such that the rotating movement of arm300and column assembly200may be activated prior to the pivoting movement of the tub frame400and the infant tub500. In some further embodiments, the rotating movement of arm300and column assembly200and the pivoting movement of the tub frame400and the infant tub500may each be controlled by a physically separate set of handles.

Located underneath the grip452is one or more actuation tabs454that a user can linearly actuate by pulling the actuation tab454towards the perimeter edge of the grip452while holding grip452. Height handles450, because they are on a same edge as the wheel handles410, have a significantly reduced width compared to the pivot/rotation handles430. The actuation tab454, when actuated, allows for the actuation of the height adjuster252(see, e.g.,FIG.4), allowing a user to increase or decrease a length of the column assembly200and, accordingly, the height of the tub frame400and the infant tub500relative to the surface on which the base100is supported, for example, the ground. Upper support shroud238slides vertically over and/or around the perimeter of the lower support member236.
