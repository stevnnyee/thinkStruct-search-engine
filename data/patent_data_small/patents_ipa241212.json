As the screw9is further screwed into the internal thread10of the cardan shaft5, the axial distance between the underside of the head15and the cardan shaft5is shortened in relation to and/or parallel to the longitudinal axis of the screw A. As a result of the shortening of the axial distance, the spur toothing11and13come into contact when the screw9is screwed in.

Due to the high frictional force, the cardan shaft5is rotated together with the screw9as the screw9is screwed in further. Since the axial force also acts on the underside of the head15, the cardan shaft5rotates together with the screw9from the tooth-on-tooth position to the nearest and/or adjacent tooth-on-gap position.

If the screw9is then screwed in further, the teeth of the cardan shaft spur toothing13are supported in the circumferential direction on tooth flanks of the teeth of the wheel hub spur toothing11, so that the screw9can continue to be screwed in even under the effect of the high frictional force without the spur toothing11and13leaving the tooth-on-gap position and/or the cardan shaft5continuing to rotate with the screw9. When the screw9is further screwed in under the effect of the high frictional force, the axial force increases again and the tooth-on-gap position is also maintained when the screw9is further screwed in, namely until the screw9is screwed into the internal thread10with the predefined tightening torque and the final mounted state of the wheel bearing arrangement1is reached.
