However, this is only exemplary and any number of band assemblies55are within the scope of the present invention. In this embodiment, the fiber reinforced polymer assemblies53extend vertically from a bead member58to the vertically adjacent SMA element52or tube. In another embodiment, the fiber reinforced polymer assemblies53can extend diagonally or at an angle from a bead member58to an SMA element52that is not vertically adjacent. For example, when viewingFIG.13, the fiber reinforced polymer assembly53associated with the left-most bead member58may extend upwardly to the right at an angle and extend or wrap around the SMA element that is second from the left or any of the other SMA elements that are not directly vertically adjacent thereto. This arrangement can help address lateral forces in the tire assembly when the vehicle goes around a corner. In another embodiment, a fiber reinforced polymer assembly53can extend around one or bead members58at the ID and one or more SMA elements52at the OD. Different arrangements of band assemblies55including any number of bead members58and any number of SMA elements52and at any angle are within the scope of the present invention.", "", "Further to the explanation involving more than one SMA element,FIG.14shows band assemblies66that include two SMA elements68toward the outside of the tire assembly (near the tread) and one bead member58toward the inside of the tire assembly (near the rim).FIG.15includes exaggerated layering to see a fiber reinforcement member56inside the polymer member70and extending around the outer surfaces68aand58aof the first and second SMA elements68and the bead member58. As shown inFIG.15, the fiber reinforced polymer assembly may include an extension portion72that extends inwardly and between the first and second SMA elements68to prevent the SMA elements from rubbing together.FIG.16shows band assemblies74that include three SMA elements76toward the outside of the tire assembly (near the tread) and one bead member58toward the inside of the tire assembly (near the rim). In this arrangement, a portion of the fiber reinforced polymer assembly78extends from the bead member58upwardly at an angle, which provides a lateral force component that helps with cornering and the like. Therefore, if the tire assembly is longitudinally bisected by a plane (e.g., the plane extends up and down with respect to the ground), the right and left sides of the fiber reinforced polymer assembly53extend upwardly at an angle that is non-parallel to the plane. This provides a lateral or horizontal component to the tension provided by the fiber reinforced polymer assembly78.

The fiber reinforcements may spiral around the bead member(s) and SMA elements (within the polymer strip, band or ply) over the 360\u00b0 of the tire assembly.", "", "It will be appreciated that each fiber reinforced polymer assembly may include multiple layers or plies, each with fiber reinforcement members therein. Furthermore, in any of the ply layers or the polymers, the fiber reinforcement members or cords may extend or run at an angle, as opposed to radially, as is shown in most of the drawings.FIG.18shows two sets of fiber reinforcement members80extending at opposite angles to one another (e.g., 45 degrees one way and 45 degrees the other way). These oppositely extending fiber reinforcement members80may be in the same polymer layer or may be in separate ply layers (e.g., one ply or layer with plus 30 degree cords and another ply or layer with negative 30 degree cords, which may be referred to as a bias ply. The fiber reinforcement members may extend radially (FIG.11) or at any angle up to 90 degrees (which is essentially extending circumferentially).", "", "In use, the present invention includes an outer ring of circumferentially wrapped SMA elements that are designed to engage when the tire assembly is loaded. In use, the SMA elements are designed to absorb the majority of the load. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the SMA elements use a unique combination of strength, recoverability, and return energy to increase tire performance.", "", "Another component of the invention is the fiber reinforced polymer assembly53used to create a rigid attachment between the SMA elements52and the tire bead elements or members58and/or the rim18. During loading, the SMA elements52deflect to generate a footprint. The diameter of the remaining SMA elements attempts to grow to accommodate the shortened chord length of the footprint section. The fiber reinforced polymer assembly53restricts the growth of the outer diameter through the semi-rigid fiber reinforcements56wrapped around the SMA elements52to the tire bead elements or members58and/or the rim18. This effectively distributes the load to the entire band assemblies55, rather than just the SMA elements at the footprint, resulting in an efficient usage of the SMA material and improved tire performance. As load is placed on the axle, the SMA elements at or near the outer diameter (OD) of the tire assembly deflect to generate the footprint. Since the circumference is shorter due to the cord length of the footprint, the circumferential tube formed by the SMA elements attempts to grow radially outwardly and/or outside the footprint. The reinforcement fibers56extending between and attaching the rim/beads and the SMA elements restricts the OD growth, therefore generating a semi-rigid body similar to a pneumatic tire.", "", "The tire belt(s)60are used to support tire assembly performance with added lateral strength. They help maintain ideal tire shape during usage. However, the tire belt(s) may be omitted.
