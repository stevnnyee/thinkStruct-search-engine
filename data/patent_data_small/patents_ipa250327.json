If two adjacent surfaces are heated, such that both phase change to viscous liquids and the melted material from the two surfaces is combined, when the heat source is removed the two surfaces will become one.

An individual component of the final gauge wheel tire assembly may be held against another individual component of the final gauge wheel tire assembly. By moving the two individual components relative to one another, either by simultaneously moving both components or by holding one component stationary while moving the other, friction between the mating surfaces will result in the generation of heat. The heat generated by the friction may be made high enough to cause the joining surfaces408,808of the individual gauge wheel components to melt and combine. When the relative movement is stopped, friction is no longer generated, thus allowing the parts to cool and become one integral component.

As applied to the RUL formula, a correction factor of one would not affect the initial wear rate. A maximum correction factor and the minimum correction factor may also be defined. In an example, the maximum correction factor is 1.15 and the minimum correction factor is 0.85. In addition to the remaining useful life, the algorithm108may additionally output the vehicle identification number associated with the remaining useful life and the average mileage accumulation rate of the vehicle.", "", "It should be appreciated that processing unit104(being remote from first device102) has access to the first customer's vehicle information and driving dynamics but could also consider vehicle information and/or driving dynamics associated with other vehicles (i.e., across a network of first devices102, such as at a number of different service centers in different physical locations). This network-wide system of data acquisition and processing provides for improved data sets, thus improving the accuracy of the calculated wear rate.", "", "Once the final wear rate is determined, the processing unit104uses the wear rate to forecast when the depth of the tire tread will decrease below a predetermined threshold. In an example, the predetermined threshold represents the minimum depth of the tire tread before the performance or safety of the vehicle is compromised. The predetermined threshold can be set based on any number of factors, which may depend on the tire, the type of vehicle, the function of vehicle, or the driver behavior. For example, tires may be designed to function better in rainy or snowy conditions, and thus include deeper grooves; the predetermined threshold may be larger for such tires, as the safety may be compromised at a different tire tread depth than a tire not designed for specific conditions. In another example, the predetermined threshold may be larger for tires that are used on large commercial vehicles due to performance or regulatory requirements. According to the National Highway Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d), tires are deemed legally unsafe when the depth of the tire tread reaches 2/32 inches. In a further example, the Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) requires a minimum of 4/32 inches for a steer tire or front-wheel tire.", "", "In another example, driver behavior can be considered when setting a predetermined threshold. For example, if a driver's behavior is classified as \u201caggressive,\u201d then the predetermined threshold may be set higher. In other words, if a driver is more aggressive, it may be preferred to have a deeper tire tread to account for such behavior. With a greater predetermined threshold, the tires would be replaced more frequently. Furthermore, similar data could be used to forecast, based on wear between treads on each tire, when to rotate a customer's tires. Thus, it should be appreciated that the predetermined threshold can vary between customers and vehicles.", "", "Importantly, system100does not merely identify that a tire needs to be replaced; rather, system100identifies the dynamic wear rate and forecasts a future point in time whereby the tire needs to be replaced. This gives the individual customer improved visibility as to when tires will need replacing, allowing for improved scheduling, cost allocation, and the like.", "", "The processing unit104may be configured to transmit a message to a second device106associated with the first customer, forecasting when the depth of the tire tread will fall below the predetermined threshold.", "", "In an example, the second device106includes a customer interface110, which may be in the form of a website portal or a software application that can be downloaded onto a mobile device. Based on the data received from the processing unit104, the customer interface110may display a tire tread forecast. In an illustrative example, the customer interface110may define a mileage at which the tires should be replaced (e.g., your tires are due to be replaced in 7,000 miles). Alternatively, the customer interface110may provide a period of time, calculated based on how many miles the customer drives during average period (e.g., replace tires in 3 months). However, such tire tread forecast may be displayed in various other forms.", "", "In another example, the second device106is a monitor disposed within the service bay. Namely, during routine maintenance, the monitor displays, to the customer, a tire tread forecast. The monitor may display information similar to the customer interface. For example, the tire tread forecast may provide a mileage at which the tires should be replaced (e.g., your tires are due to be replaced in 7,000 miles). The monitor may also provide a period of time, calculated based on how many miles the customer drives during an average period (e.g., replace tires in 3 months). Such tire tread forecast may be displayed in various other forms. The monitor may also provide information unrelated to tire tread forecast, including, but not limited to, date of last oil change, estimated oil change date, vehicle mileage information, and estimated time of service.", "", "Moreover, the tire tread depth forecasting may be dynamic. In other words, each time the customer visits an automotive maintenance center, additional data is collected for the processing unit104to transmit to the second device106. The additional data may be used to adjust the correction factor to provide a more accurate remaining useful life calculation. Thus, the customer interface110may display an updated tire tread forecast each time the customer visits an automotive maintenance center. In addition to the tire tread forecast, the customer interface110may notify the customer when the tires should, or should almost, be replaced. Thus, rather than a user having to periodically check the user interface110, the second device106may notify the user when, for example, the tire tread depth forecasts that the tires should be replace in 500 miles, 100 miles, or immediately. In addition, the second device106may include functions that allow the customer to initiate or schedule an appointment for a tire change.", "", "FIG.5illustrates a flow chart diagram for forecasting a depth of a tire tread, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. The flow chart diagram500for forecasting a depth of a tire tread includes measuring a first depth of the tire tread502and measuring a second depth of the tire tread504. The measurement of the first depth of the tire tread and the measurement of the second depth of the tire tread may be taken at different times. For example, a customer may visit an automotive maintenance center regularly to get an oil change. At one oil change, the first depth of the tire tread may be measured. As previously introduced, the first depth of the tire tread may be measured in a variety of ways using a variety of tools. For example, an automotive technician may measure the depth of each groove on the tire using a handheld device. The measurements, which correspond to each groove on each tire, can then be averaged to provide the first depth of the tire tread. Again, by averaging such measurements, the impact from measurement variability and changes in groove depth due to tire rotations can be minimized. As a result, a more accurate tire tread depth may be determined.", "", "Then the customer may return to the automotive maintenance center for a second oil change. At this visit, the second depth of the tire tread may be measured. Similar to the first measurement, the second depth of the tire tread may be measured in a variety of ways using a variety of tools. Further, the second depth of the tire tread does not have to be measured using the same method or tools as the measurement for the first tire tread. By performing first and second measurements at different visits to the maintenance center, the measurements provide additional value in determining the wear rate of the user over a number of miles or a period of time.", "", "In addition, this process can be repeated each time the customer visits the maintenance center, which may lead to a more accurate wear rate calculation. For example, a third depth of the tire tread may be measured, further updating the above process. Overall, the present disclosure does not identify a maximum number of tire tread depth measurements. Instead, additional measurements may increase the accuracy of the forecasting. Thus, the systems and methods described herein can be used in a quick maintenance environment, allowing the tire tread depth to be collected on several occasions. Furthermore, as introduced above, the processing unit104, which functions to receive data corresponding to the first depth of the tire and the second depth of the tire, may be centrally located. Based on this configuration, the first customer is not required to visit the same location for both the measurement of the second depth of the tire tread and the first depth of the tire tread.", "", "The flow chart diagram500includes a step for associating the first depth of the tire tread and the second depth of the tire tread with a first customer506. This association process can be completed in any of a number of ways. For example, the first customer may be associated with the tire tread depth measurements through personal identification information, such as name, date of birth, or driver license. The first customer may also be associated with the tire tread depth measurements through vehicle information, such as VIN number or license plate number. For example, a camera (as shown inFIG.2) can be positioned to record and collect the license plate number of a vehicle as it drives over the Hunter System or into an automotive bay. Thus, the tire tread data may be associated with a customer, the vehicle, or a combination of the customer and the vehicle. In an example, a customer may have multiple cars. An association between the tread data with the customer and the specific car of the customer may improve the accuracy of the system. The first depth of the tire tread and the second depth of the tire tread are then communicated to the processing unit508. This communication step can vary and depend on the first device. For example, the first device may include a transmitter that automatically sends the tire tread depth data to the processing unit. Alternatively, a vehicle technician may communicate the tire tread depth data by, for example, inputting the data into a user interface on an intermediary device that transmits the data to the processing unit.", "", "Once received, the processing unit uses the first depth of the tire tread and the second depth of the tire tread. Namely, the processing unit includes an algorithm to determine a wear rate. The algorithm considers the first depth of the tire tread, the second depth of a tire tread, and a plurality of factors associated with the first customer to determine the wear rate. As discussed in reference toFIG.1, the algorithm calculates an initial wear rate based on a sub-set of the plurality of factors associated with the first customer, which may include the vehicle make, the vehicle model, and the vehicle weight. Once the initial wear rate is calculated, a correction factor is applied. The correction factor also uses a sub-set of the plurality of factors to account for the driver behavior, vehicle dynamics, and tire design. Thus, the final wear rate may be unique to the vehicle and the first customer by considering the previously measured tread depth data and plurality of factors associated with the first customer.", "", "Once the final wear rate is determined, it can be used to determine when the depth of the tire tread will decrease below a predetermined threshold510. Again, as discussed above, the predetermined threshold can be set based on any number of factors, which may depend on the tire, the type of vehicle, or the function of vehicle. Thus, it should be appreciated that the predetermined threshold can vary between customers or vehicles. A message can then be communicated to the first customer forecasting when the depth of the tire tread will fall below the predetermined threshold512.", "", "The following paragraph provides an illustrative example of the flow chart diagram for forecasting a depth of a tire tread inFIG.5. A customer visits an automotive maintenance center, which is a first visit. During this visit, the tread depth of the tire is measured. Then, the customer leaves the automotive center. The customer returns, for example, when their vehicle requires an oil change. During this second visit, the tread depth of the tire is again measured. These measurements (from the first visit and from the second visit) are associated with the first customer and then communicated to a processing unit. The processing unit uses these measurements, along with a plurality of variables associated with the first customer, to determine a wear rate. Subsequently, the wear rate is used to determine when the tire tread depth is forecasted to fall below a predetermined threshold. In other words, the wear rate can be used to forecast the remaining life of the tire before a tire change is necessary. A message can then be communicated to the first customer forecasting when the depth of the tire tread will fall below the predetermined threshold.", "", "FIGS.6A to6Dillustrate prediction error results of a system for forecasting a depth of a tire tread, according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. In the example Figures, the y-axis reflects an error, which corresponds to 1/32 inches. While any increment of error can be used, 1/32 inches reflects the industry standard measurement increment when evaluating tire tread depth and when evaluating prediction accuracy. Further, the x-axis reflects the odometer mileage of predictions.", "", "Namely,FIGS.6A to6Dplot the prediction error rate of the algorithm (as described in reference toFIG.1) against odometer readings for different number of visits and number of vehicles. For example,FIG.6Acompares the prediction error rate based on four visits for twelve different vehicles. Likewise,FIG.6Bcompares the prediction error rate based on four visits for twenty-seven different vehicles;FIG.6Ccompares the prediction error rate based on three visits for two-hundred and twelve different vehicles; andFIG.6Dcompares the prediction error rate based on four visits for two-hundred and twelve different vehicles. As shown inFIG.6C, using first3visits, the algorithm is able to project future tread depth over the next 22,500 miles of driving, with 95% of tread projections within approximately \u00b1 1/32nd inches across two-hundred and twelve vehicles sampled.", "", "In an example validation process for the previously disclosed algorithm, a vehicle may visit an automotive maintenance center on multiple occasions, providing several data points on tread measurement history. This information may be used as an input to the algorithm and a validation output based on actual data. For example, the first three visits may be used as inputs into the algorithm. Each visit beyond the third visit could be used to validate predictions and the plot error. Such prediction errors may follow a normal distribution. Moreover, the accuracy or precision of the algorithm may provide accurate predictions but decrease as prediction mileage increases. This trend is illustrated as more vehicles are included in the validation process.FIGS.6A,6B, and6Ddemonstrate this improvement when comparing samples of twelve vehicles, twenty-seven vehicles, and two-hundred and twelve vehicles using the algorithm with four visits.FIG.6Cshows the equivalent results using the algorithm with three visits.", "", "The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description.

The controller210may be configured to rely on the remote sensors to navigate the practice arena and establish driving routes. Once driven, the coordinates of these driving routes may be stored within the memory of the controller210for later selection by the user during further practice sessions. The user may also indicate remote start and stop points along the driving routes that approximate a calf's start and stop points during rodeo events. This customization enables the development of muscle memory corresponding to the practice routines that can be reliably recreated during rodeo events for improved performance. It will be appreciated that the remote-control modality and/or autonomous driving capabilities enable the user to practice without assistance from another person. This is an advantage over traditional roping dummies pulled by an ATV that require two people to practice.", "", "In some embodiments, the controller210may obtain readings from various sensors/chips (e.g., magnetometer, GPS module, proximity sensor, IR sensor, etc.) so as to determine the position, speed, and heading of the vehicle102. In some embodiments, the system for roping practice100may comprise a local positioning system (LPS) using radio frequency (RF) to determine relative position, speed, heading, etc. LPS determine the precise location within a defined area by measuring signal strength, time of flight, or angle of arrival from multiple fixed reference points, enabling accurate triangulation. RF-based LPS are particularly useful in indoor environments where GPS signals are weak or unavailable, providing high-precision, real-time tracking, which is useful in enclosed arena practices. Controlling the vehicle102based on the readings by the various sensors/chips/LPS/etc. may be accomplished using software. In some embodiments, the controller210may utilize proportional-integral-derivatives (PID), hardcoding, full state feedback, or other methods when interpreting readings and executing instructions to thereby control the vehicle102. In some embodiments, a user may customize vehicle routes, speed, engine-cutoff times based on the switch208, among other features.", "", "In some methods of use, a user would couple the dummy104to the vehicle102for roping practice. In a default state (due to spring242), the contact plate222is in contact with the switch208, closing a circuit. With the circuit closed, the vehicle may started and placed into drive. Depending on the configuration, the vehicle may turn at pre-programmed intervals or may turn based upon one or more signals (e.g., proximity sensors, GPS signals, LPS signals, etc.) received and processed by the controller210. As a result, the vehicle210begins driving without the need of a person on the vehicle102to operate it. A user may then pursue the dummy104with a lasso. Once the user successfully lassos the dummy104, the contact plate222is decoupled from the switch208, thereby opening the circuit and cutting the power to the vehicle102, thereby stopping the vehicle102to allow the user to reset. It will be appreciated that cutting power to the vehicle102is not required, and other methods, such as disengaging a transmission, applying brakes, or other methods may be utilized to stop the vehicle from moving forward.", "", "Once stopped, the contact plate222once again contacts the switch208, thereby closing the circuit once again. While described as contacting the switch208, it will be appreciated that contactless methods, such as magnetic fields, may also be used to close the circuit. With the circuit closed, the vehicle102is ready to be initiated by a user to begin moving once again. In some embodiments, the vehicle102may be controlled, such as via the controller210, to automatically restart moving after a predetermined time. In other words, once the vehicle is stopped, a user may remove the lasso and get ready to pursue once again (such as by mounting a horse), with the vehicle automatically starting and/or commencing to drive forward when the set time expires (e.g., 45 seconds). In some embodiments, a user may initiate the vehicle driving using input on the vehicle102itself or using a remote or smartphone application. As such, a user may easily practice roping without the need of a second person.", "", "Accordingly, the system for roping, as described herein, overcomes the issues in the prior art by providing a roping dummy that enables a user to practice by themself under circumstances closely approximating real life situations and/or rodeo conditions, thereby leading to faster improvement in their roping abilities.", "", "It will be appreciated that systems and methods according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure may include, incorporate, or otherwise comprise properties or features (e.g., components, members, elements, parts, and/or portions) described in other embodiments.
