The winding mechanism6is located under the ratchet seat5at the station, and the winding mechanism6includes a first lifting mechanism601and a first driving mechanism602with position feedback and torque feedback. In practical application, the first driving mechanism602is a servo motor, and the first lifting mechanism601is a sliding table cylinder. The sliding table cylinder drives the servo motor to lift and lower. The output end of the servo motor is provided with a sleeve603, which is a12-angle sleeve. The lower part of the ratchet shaft501is a hexagonal shaft. Both the sleeve603and the hexagonal shaft are provided with a guide structure.

When the first lifting mechanism601is lowered, the sleeve603and the ratchet shaft501are disconnected. For example, when the rotation shaft102of the safety belt retractor1with a certain specification rotates 21+0.5 turns from the fully relaxed state, the torque meets the requirements, then at the winding station, the sliding table cylinder drives the servo motor to lift, the sleeve603and the ratchet shaft501form a transmission connection, the servo motor drives the rotation shaft102to rotate21turns at a faster speed, and then the sliding table cylinder lowers, the sleeve603and the ratchet shaft501are disconnected, and the coil spring103tends to drive the rotation shaft102to reverse, because the ratchet shaft501is locked due to reverse rotation, the rotation shaft102remains in the state of21turns.

The winding mechanism6under this station works the same as the winding mechanism6of the winding station, which lifts first to complete the transmission connection, and then drives the rotation shaft102to rotate. The difference is that the servo motor of this station drives the rotation shaft102to rotate at a relatively slow speed. When the displacement sensor704generates a displacement signal and the displacement value is within the set displacement value range, it indicates that the stop slot1021coincides with the socket1011, and the detection pin707has been inserted into the stop slot1021under the spring force.

Sipes are provided to the tire to effectively soften the tire material and to improve grip particularly of winter tires. Thus, the shapes of the lamella blades of the mould define the shapes of the sipes of the tire. Likewise, the shapes of the ridges of the mould defined the shapes of the grooves of the tire. The sipes and the grooves are arranged on a tread of a tire, as well known. Moreover, in certain types of tires, the transversal grooves (393,394,395,396;FIG.3a) define a direction of rotation R for the tire.

Electrification of vehicles is of course a good solution to replace fossil fuel for mobility. This path is however penalized by the density of the electricity storage in the batteries. Mobile Carbon Capture is considered a transitional technology. As a retrofit option, it will be most useful in the period while current internal combustion engine vehicles are replaced by other alternatives with lower emissions. The length of that period will be influenced by the constrained supply of EVs in adequate quantities. Carbon dioxide capture is an alternative, if one can capture with limited energy penalty, and convert captured carbon dioxide into fuels using renewable electricity. This however requires the efficient capture and storage of the carbon dioxide of engine exhaust while moving or in transit. The capture of carbon dioxide while in transit present several problems, one of which is the efficient storage of the captured carbon dioxide. Current methods require large and heavy storage tanks attached to the vehicles. Or alternatively, a higher energy usage to liquefy and compress the collected CO2 into high pressure storage.

These sensors may include the sensors310, as described herein.", "", "The sensors508may also include a location sensor configured to detect location data associated with the vehicle102. The location sensor may be a GPS unit or any other global location detection device. The ECU504may use the location data along with the map data stored in the memory510to determine a location of the vehicle. In other embodiments, the location sensor has access to the map data and may determine the location of the vehicle and provide the location of the vehicle to the ECU504.", "", "The vehicle102includes an actuator512, which may be one or more actuators, configured to adjust the location of the hitch106and/or the guide302. The actuator512may be controlled by the ECU504or may have one or more processors of its own to perform the functions described herein.", "", "The memory510is connected to the ECU504and may be connected to any other component of the vehicle102. The memory510is configured to store any data described herein, such as the map data, the location data, the vehicle data, the trailer data, and any data received from the remote data server516via the transceiver506. The vehicle data associated with the vehicle102may indicate the features, capabilities, reference points, and measurements of the vehicle102. The trailer data associated with the trailer104may indicate the features, capabilities, reference points, and measurements of the trailer104.", "", "The ECU504may use the detected data from the sensors508to provide feedback to the driver, and the ECU504may use the actuator512to move the hitch106to the ideal hitch position. The ideal hitch position may be determined by first determining a relative location and orientation of the trailer104and the vehicle102. The ECU504may use sensor data from various sensors (e.g., rear corner sensors, rear-view camera, clearance sensors, angle detection sensor) to determine the relative location and orientation of the trailer104and the vehicle102.", "", "The remote data server516includes a processor518, a memory522, and a transceiver520. The processor518of the remote data server516may be one or more computer processors configured to execute instructions stored in non-transitory memory522. The remote data server516may store data, such as traffic data, road condition data, and map data in the memory522and communicate the stored data to the vehicle102via the transceiver520. While only one remote data server516is shown, any number of remote data servers in communication with each other may be used.", "", "As used herein, \u201csubstantially\u201d may refer to being within plus or minus 10% of the value.", "", "Exemplary embodiments of the methods/systems have been disclosed in an illustrative style.
