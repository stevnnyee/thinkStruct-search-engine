However, it is quite possible to perform these in a first electronic device connected to the sensor, equipped with a microcontroller or microprocessor and coupled to sufficient memory space to perform the elementary mathematical operations required by the method.", "", "Here, the first step consists of determining the reference speed, taking as reference speed the angular rotation speed. For this, the first temporal signal101must be phased with a reference azimuthal position of the wheel turn. To this end, the first signal101shows regular quite strong falls in amplitude111,112which reflect the passage through the contact patch of the angular sector carrying the accelerometer. Naturally, these downward and upward slopes of the falls111,112represent respectively the entry and exit of the contact patch. The centre of the contact patch is the middle of the interval separating the entry and exit of the contact patch. This centre is assigned the azimuthal position of 0 degrees which will be our azimuthal reference. By taking a second angular reference on the next signal fall112for example, the signal101is determined for a wheel turn of 360 degrees and a temporal interval associated with this wheel turn. The reference speed Wreferenceis defined as the ratio of angular variation between the two centres of the contact patch to the temporal interval separating these two azimuthal positions. This reference speed Wreferenceis assigned to the portion of the signal situated between these two centres of the contact area. Naturally, two non-contiguous falls111,115of the temporal signal101could be considered for determining a second reference speed Wreferenceand assigning the second speed to the portion of the signal101situated between the two falls111,115.", "", "FIG.3shows the result of the step of angular resampling of the temporal signal101. Thus, using the determination of the centres of the contact patch for each fall in temporal signal performed in the preceding step, it is easy to phase the temporal signal with the wheel turn over 360 degrees. Then the discretized measurement points are linearly distributed over the wheel turn. Even if an angular positioning error is made at this step, a linear interpolation performed for example during the data aggregation step will smooth out the results and minimize the angular positioning error. In a more sophisticated fashion, a reference speed is evaluated on each wheel turn. It is possible to assign evolving angular speeds to the wheel turn by taking into account reference speeds of contiguous turns. For example, having determined the reference speeds over three consecutive turns, it is possible to assign to the central wheel turn a first reference speed for the first quarter wheel turn, being the barycentric speed of the reference speed of the preceding weighted turn 2 and the reference speed of the current weighted turn 1. The following quarter will have a reference speed being the barycentric speed of the reference speed of the current weighted turn 2 and the reference speed of the preceding weighted turn 1. The third quarter wheel turn will have a reference speed being the barycentric speed of the reference speed of the current weighted turn 2 and the reference speed of the next weighted turn 1. Finally, the last quarter wheel turn will have a reference speed being the barycentric speed of the reference speed of the current weighted turn 1 and the reference speed of the next weighted turn 2. All discretized measurement points are distributed over each quarter wheel turn in proportion to the ratio of reference speeds of each quarter turn to the reference speed of the current turn. Other methods for smoothing the points may also be applied. Here, the spatial discretization of points is not regular because of the variable rolling speed. It is quite possible to make this discretization of points of signal102regular by applying a method of interpolating measurement points over a given angular distribution for the wheel turn. This then provides an angularly resampled signal102with a regular angular pitch.FIG.3shows the angularly resampled signal102which is periodic to the wheel turn with arbitrary discretization of measurement points.", "", "FIG.4shows the result of the step of normalizing the first angularly resampled signal102without interpolation of points. Thus, using the periodicity to the wheel turn of the angularly resampled wheel-turn signal, it is easy to break down the angular signal over a wheel turn or over a multiple of the wheel turn as illustrated inFIG.4, here 12 wheel turns. The normalization step consists of dividing the amplitude of the signal by the power function squared of the reference speed associated with each portion of a wheel turn. The reference speed was determined during the first signal processing step101for example. The reference speed is an angular speed. The result observed on curves103and103bisis that the amplitude of the normalized signal is similar for each wheel turn. We no longer see the strong variations in amplitude between the various wheel turns performed at difference speeds and on different roads. Also, the signal is centred on the unit value. Then the wheel turn segments are superposed over the same angular interval of a length which is an integral multiple of 360 degrees, as shown by the grey curves which here form a curve bundle103. This takes into account the spread of measurements between wheel turns, which is accentuated by the fact that the signals have not been corrected for terrestrial gravity. However, if a low-pass filter is applied, we obtain black curve103biswhich is smoother since cleaned of certain parasitic noise. This allows us to see that signal103bisis periodic to the wheel turn with slight variations between wheel turns. At the end of this normalization of signal102, we obtain an angularly resampled normalized signal103.FIG.4shows the angularly resampled normalized signal103which is centred on the unit value, as confirmed by the filter applied to curve103bis.", "", "FIG.5is the result of the step of aggregation of the data from signal103from the preceding step, which is an optional step. Here, the segments of each wheel turn are superposed over the same angular interval of a length of 360 degrees, as shown by the grey curves which here form a curve bundle104. This takes into account the spread of measurements between each wheel turn, which is accentuated by the fact that the signals have not been corrected for terrestrial gravity. However, if we apply a correction for terrestrial gravity to each wheel turn before the normalization step, since the accelerometer is here sensitive to terrestrial gravity, data aggregation by a method of the mean over a decile interval determines the curve104bis, which is much more stable for the wheel turn. This gives a signal for tyre casing deformation subjected to external forces, in particular the static load in this case. This signal104bisis representative of the measurement of the tyre casing in rolling condition at variable speed on ground of any roughness. This curve is an invariant of the tyre casing in rolling condition under static load in a state mounted on the rim.", "", "FIG.6is an illustration to explain the computation of the positive S+and negative S\u2212energy densities on an angularly resampled normalized wheel-turn signal SigTDRcorresponding to a single wheel turn.

The elongation requirement may depend on other properties of the puncture resistant layer including, but not limited to, puncture resistance strength and delamination strength (tack between the carcass16and the puncture resistant layer20).

At the zero yaw angle position the virtual yaw pivot is 1590 mm forward of the origin, straight ahead. The vertical centreline (X inFIG.1) of the vehicle-trailer coupling is at approximately 620 mm on the y axis.
