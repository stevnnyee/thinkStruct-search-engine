The present disclosure provides devices, systems, and methods that provide a configurable thermoplastic wheel with improved durability, airflow properties, and design modularity, among other benefits.", "", "The described wheel is made of a continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic, which offers substantial weight reduction compared to typical aluminum or steel wheels, and is designed to improve vehicle range and ride quality. Although composite materials have been used to make high performance automotive wheels, these wheels are designed using continuous fiber reinforced thermoset composite materials with the typical \u2018barrel-hub-spoke\u2019 configuration, using an integrated spoke/mag wheel face that is either molded into the hub and drum (also referred to as a barrel), or fastened to the hub and drum with hardware.", "", "The described wheel can use a continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite drum as the primary structure of the wheel, and connect various elements to the drum to provide additional structure. By using a thermoplastic composite for the drum (the largest component of the wheel), significant weight savings can be achieved in the wheel, which can lead to improved fuel or battery efficiency, but these lighter materials are more susceptible to damage than traditional alloy materials used in drums. Accordingly, the design of the drum includes various features to improve the resiliency of the drum against damage and to provide improved aerodynamics, and for the inclusions of one or more of a halo and a cap at different portions of the drum to protect the underlying drum and provide (in the event of damage) for easier repair or replacement than the drum or the wheel as a whole.", "", "The drum may be used together with an outer halo or \u201caero ring\u201d that forms the radial portion of the wheel face, and can be configured for each vehicle and brake type to tailor the aerodynamic and brake cooling properties of the wheel to a particular vehicle or use case for the vehicle. The halo and a centrally positioned cap, can be made of a thermoplastic or another material, and provides a protective layer around the outward facing elements of the drum; reducing the risk of damage to the lightweight drum, and providing for adjustments to the aerodynamics, air intake/outtake properties, and aesthetics of the wheel. Accordingly, the prior designs lack a selectively replaceable outer wheel face that provides the various benefits of the wheel described herein.", "", "The described wheel includes various individual thermoplastic components, joined together to create a single, structural, lightweight wheel. The wheel uses thermoplastic composite materials, which are capable of being produced in high rates with significant automation, and are lower cost than traditional thermoset composite materials. The wheel uses an outer halo that comprises the outer portion of the wheel face surface, which includes an inner aerodynamic \u2018flat\u2019 profile. Together, these components can be designed to meet the unique aerodynamic and brake cooling requirements for specific vehicle types.", "", "In addition to customizing the halo for aerodynamic and cooling purposes, the halo and the cosmetic surface panel inside of the halo can be changed to alter the aesthetics of the wheel based on personal design preferences. The halo can be easily replaced, which keeps the wheel looking new and \u2018fresh\u2019 (e.g., after curb impact, debris strike, etc.), and protects the inner drum from damage.", "", "Additionally, the presently described wheels offer benefits in reducing vibration and sound produced by the wheels, which may be particularly important in electric vehicles (or hybrid vehicles operating in electric mode) due to the lack of engine noise compared to vehicles using internal combustion engines.", "", "FIGS.1A-1Cillustrate example designs for a wheel100, according to embodiments of the present disclosure.

These different materials can including different mixtures of resin/fiber for a carbon-fiber reinforced thermoplastic that offer different mechanical properties than the thermoplastic used in the wheel drum130as well as thermoset plastics, metal alloys, or the like.", "", "In various embodiments, the halo140extends to cover the outward surfaces of the first rim220aso that the first rim220ais protected from curb strikes or debris strikes; allowing for the smaller, less expensive, and potentially more damage-resilient halo140to make contact with a curb810or debris820instead of the drum130. Because the halo140extends over the rim220a(at or beyond the first diameter D1) of the drum130and extends to the third diameter D3, any impact between the first diameter D1 and the third diameter D3 is absorbed by the halo140; preventing damage to the underlying portions of the larger and more difficult to replace drum130. Accordingly, by using the design described herein, after a driver strikes a curb810, the halo140is damaged but the drum130remains undamaged. After such a curb strike or other damage is sustained, the damaged halo140may be removed from the wheel100and be replaced with another instance of the halo140, without having to replace other components of the wheel100, thereby easing repair and replacement as an additional benefit of the present design.", "", "Similarly, by using the design described herein, after debris820strikes and damages the halo140, the damaged halo140may be removed from the wheel100and replaced with another instance of the halo140, without having to replace other components of the wheel100.", "", "Because the facing170is generally \u201cflat\u201d and is substantially perpendicular to an axis270of rotation for the wheel100(and therefore parallel to a direction of travel for the wheel100), any debris820that strikes the facing170is likely to do so at an oblique angle of impact; thereby avoiding full transfer of impact force to the wheel100and reducing the likelihood of the debris820causing damage to the facing170. In some embodiments, the facing170may include additional layers of material or coatings that are not present elsewhere on the drum130, to provide greater protection on the external portions of the wheel100without adding weight to portions of the wheel that do not need such protection.", "", "Although the well260provides surfaces that are angled towards the direction of travel for the wheel100that debris820may strike (e.g., not parallel to the direction of travel), the area of the well260is smaller than the wheel100as a whole (reducing the odds of a strike) and are presented at a sloped angle to the direction of travel; thereby increasing the effective thickness of the material and thereby reducing the likelihood of a direct impact for debris820. The sloped walls of the well260provided by the present design increase the odds of any debris820that does strike the well260to glance off with lower transfer of force than a direct impact, thereby improving the resiliency of the wheel100against damage. In some embodiments, the cap150extends to be flush with the facing170; thereby protecting any such surfaces of the well260from debris strikes by not exposing those surfaces.", "", "FIGS.9A-9Billustrate differences in airflows in different example wheel designs, according to embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown inFIG.9A, a first configuration of a wheel100with a first halo140aand first facing170aproduces a first airflow pattern910a(generally or collectively, airflow pattern910), while a second configuration of a wheel, as shown inFIG.9B, produces a second airflow pattern910bvia a second halo140band second facing170b.", "", "As shown, different amounts of air, at different locations on the wheels100in each of the airflow patterns910are drawn into the wheel assembly as intake air920, directed to flow past the wheel assembly as pass-by air930, or ejected from the wheel assembly as outflow air940.", "", "Because the facing170is generally perpendicular to the direction of travel and does not include any through holes into the cavity330, the surrounding air is drawn into the wheel assembly via the ducts440in the halo140forward on the vehicle in the direction of travel and routed into the cavity330via the vents310. The air drawn into the cavity300is then ejected from the cavity300, having absorbed heat from the components in the cavity330, in the reverse route-exiting the vents310and then the ducts440in the halo140rearward on the vehicle in the direction of travel. The intake air920may be draw into the forward ducts400via air intake scoops or other structures on the halo140, and ejected from the cavity300via a pressure differential (e.g., being forced out may new incoming intake air920or drawn out via a suction effect from the lower pressure pass-by air930at rearward ducts400, etc.", "", "By excluding through holes, the facing170provides fewer inlets or outlets for air, and thereby decreases the aerodynamic drag on the wheel100associated with the intake and outtake of air to/from the cavity330and turbulent effects at the intake and outtake points. As up to 30% of the aerodynamic drag of a modern vehicle can be attributed to the wheels, regulating the amount of air that is permitted to flow into the wheel assembly can noticeably improve the aerodynamic performance of the vehicle as a whole; thereby improving fuel economy or battery range, particularly when operated at higher speeds as air drag increases. However, as the wheels include components that may require cooling (e.g., brake pads, electric motors, electrical generators, wheel bearings, etc.), the improvements to aerodynamic performance may need to be balanced for competing needs for aerodynamic efficiency and cooling ability. For example, decreasing the amount of air drawn into the wheel assembly can increase aerodynamic performance, but also decreases the amount of air available for cooling (e.g., of brakes held in the cavity330of the wheel100), while increasing the amount of air drawn into the wheel assembly can decrease aerodynamic performance, but increases the amount of air available for cooling.", "", "By installing selectively configurable wheels100, as discussed in the present disclosure, a user can select a halo140with different numbers, sizes, shapes, or arrangements of ducts440, thereby affecting how much air is drawn into the cavity330of the wheel100, which may be used to cool any components (e.g., breaks) held therein, versus being directed to pass by the wheel100. These considerations may be based on the operational profile of the vehicle to adjust for the speed of travel, cooling needs of internal components, and susceptibility to damage of the wheel100in the operational environment.", "", "For example, a user of a vehicle that is primarily driven on a highway, may prefer a halo140design that helps reduce aerodynamic drag at higher speeds at the expense of less intake of cooling air, as the brakes are used less frequently on controlled access highways than in other environments, which thereby improves fuel/battery efficiency by reducing airflow through the wheel100. In contrast, that same user of the same vehicle may prefer a different design of halo140that offers a different airflow pattern910when using the vehicle off-road (e.g., emphasizing debris protection over weight and drag reduction) or driving within a city (e.g., emphasizing air through-put to the brake pads due to more frequent use in city vs. highway driving over weight and drag reduction). Additionally, that same user of the same vehicle may prefer a different design for the halo140when operating the vehicle in the winter versus the summer while primarily operating on controlled access highways, due to the air used to cool components being colder and the presence of more debris (in the form of road salt, gravel, or cinders); changing the user's relative needs for cooling and protection without affecting the driving patterns for the vehicle.", "", "The configurable wheel100of the present disclosure therefore provides several advantages to the user, allowing for the customization of the wheel100to account for differing priorities for aerodynamics, protection, and cooling capabilities via selectively removable sub-components of the wheel assembly.", "", "FIG.10is a flowchart of an example method1000for wheel configuration or repair, according to embodiments of the present disclosure.", "", "Method1000begins at block1010, where an operator attaches a tire to a sidewall230of the drum130.
