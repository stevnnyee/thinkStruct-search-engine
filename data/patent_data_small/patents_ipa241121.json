For instance, rotation of the assembly bracket (and thereby the set reference point) may cause the set reference point to align with the frame-static reference sensor. The alignment may correspond to a set directional angle. Thus, detection of the set reference point may indicate that the steerable wheel is at the set directional angle (e.g., irrespective of any target steering angle or movement output).", "", "Following or immediately prior to1242, the method1200may further optionally include the step1244of determining a current steering angle. In particular, the determination of1244may be based on one or more signals detected at or received from the angle sensor. For instance,1244may include receiving a position signal from the encoder (e.g., one or more angle sensors), and determining an angle reading based on the position signal.

In some such embodiments, an equivalent angle is calculated using a modulo based on the determined output position (e.g., directional angle thereof).

Subsequently, separate angular distances may be calculated for both the directional angle of the determined output position and its equivalent angle. The smallest angular distance between the two may be determined.

More specifically, the present invention is focussed primarily on a novel design for a non-pneumatic (or \u201cairless\u201d) tire22of the wheel18. Referring to the assembled wheel18shown inFIGS.3through5, the wheel features a metal rim24composed a cylindrical outer drum26spanning concentrically around a central rotational axis28at a radial distance therefrom, and an inner web32in the form of a circular plate that is affixed to an internal surface of the outer drum26to occupy the internal circular area delimited thereby.

The tire body38has two axially opposing sides42,44spaced apart in the axial direction denoted by the central rotational axis28. Each tire body segment40spans a respective partial circumferential distance around the central rotational axis28so that a convex outer surface46of each segment40defines a respective span of the overall tire body's outer circumference, while a concave inner surface48of each segment40likewise defines a respective span of the overall tire body's inner circumference. Opposing first and second sides50,52of each segment face opposing circumferential directions around the central rotational axis28of the tire, and each lie in a respective radial plane thereof.

That is, one side50of each segment has a female recessed area50A therein, while the opposing side52has a male protruding area52A thereon that is sized and shaped to mate with the recessed area50A of the adjacent segment in the assembled tire. In the illustrated embodiment, each recessed area50A and protruding area52A has a simple rectangular shape spanning the full radial dimension of the respective end50,52of the tire segment40between the inner and outer surfaces48,46thereof. Each recessed area50A and protruding area52A is centered in the axial direction of the respective segment40so that the male and female areas50A,52A mate together at the mid-plane PMof the tire and block axial separation of adjacent segments from one another in both axial directions moving outward from said mid-plane.", "", "Each segment40has a singular hollow cavity54therein that that penetrates axially and fully through the segment40, and is thus open at both of the two axially opposing ends of the segment40A,40B (i.e. at the axially opposing sides or faces42,44of the tire body38). The hollow cavities54are empty, and thus void of the constituent rubber material of the tire body segments40, and thereby increase the radial compressibility of the segments compared to a solid rubber segment that would lack any such voids between the inner and outer circumference of the tire. The respective cavity54of each tire body segment40resides at a radially intermediate region of the segment that is spaced inwardly from each of the inner and outer surfaces48,46thereof. Since each segment40has only a singular respective cavity54therein, and the segments40are all identical to one another, the assembled tire thus features a singular row of cavities54residing at equal radial distance DR from the central rotational axis28. The tire thus features only one set of cavities54therein, characterized by their equal radial distance DR from the central rotational axis28, and thus denoting a singular circular array of such cavities. More detail about particularly beneficial aspects of the geometry of each cavity are disclosed herein further below.", "", "Embedded within the tire body38are mounting elements for use in securing the tire body38to the cylindrical outer drum26of the rim24at the outer surface thereof over which the inner circumference28of the tire body38is fitted by individual fastening of the tire body segments40to the outer drum26of the rim24. With reference toFIGS.10and11, a respective mounting plate56of elongated rectangular bar-shape lies axially of each segment40in a radially inner region thereof that is situated between the cavity-containing intermediate region and the inner surface48of the segment40.

An enlarged head60B of each fastener60resides on the outer side of the mounting plate56that faces toward the outer circumference of the tire. Preferably, each fastening hole58of the mounting plate56is square in shape, and each threaded fastener60is a carriage bolt with a square shoulder underlying the head60B of the fastener60. Each square hole58in the mounting plate56is sized to accommodate the square shoulder of the carriage bolt fastener60and constrain the carriage bolt fastener60against rotation.", "", "Accordingly, rotation of the fastener60is not only resisted by the rubber of the tire body segment40that envelopes the embedded fastener head60B and embedded portion of the fastener stud60A, but also is blocked by the cooperative action between the straight sided mounting plate hole58and the mating shape of the fastener's flat-sided shoulder. Each mounting plate56resides centrally between the male and female profiled sides50,52of the respective tire body segment40in the circumferential direction of the tire body. The rim24features an array of holes passing radially through the outer drum26of the rim. These holes in the rim are arranged in sets of matching hole quantity and hole layout to the respective sets of fasteners60in the tire segments40. Each mounting plate56may have the fasteners60pre-welded thereto, whereby the welded-together plate and fasteners form a pre-assembled mounting unit that's embedded into each tire segment during molded production thereof.

Once the rubber is hardened, this further anchors the mounting plate56and affixed fasteners60in place within the tire segment. This mechanical anchoring is further reinforced by the chemically-formed bond between the hardened rubber and the coated mounting plate. In the illustrated embodiment, multiple mould-through openings63of various shapes are defined in the plate at various locations spread across and along the plate, but it will be appreciated that the quantity, location(s) and shape(s) of the mould-through opening(s) may vary.", "", "To assemble the illustrated tire ofFIGS.3-5, a user places each segment40individually onto the outer drum26of the rim24in order to seat the inner surface48of the segment40on the convex outer surface of the rim's cylindrical drum26, and thereby inserts the four fastener studs60A of that segment40through a respective set of holes in the outer drum26of the rim24. At this point, locknuts62are threaded onto the free ends of the fastener studs60A and tightened up against the interior of the rim's outer drum26, thereby securing the tire body segment40in place on the rim24. This process is repeated until all the tire body segments40are secured in place, thereby collectively forming the overall tire body38that now fully spans around the rim24to define a completed wheel that is ready for mounting to the wheel hub of a pivot irrigator's drive tower16. With the female recessed area50A of each segment40spanning the full radial dimension of the segment's first side50up to the outer surface46thereof, the male and female profiles of the segment sides50,52form slidably matable tongues and grooves that allow radial sliding of each segment into place beside the previously installed segment.", "", "The tire body38features integrally-moulded rubber tread ribs64at spaced positions around the outer circumference of the tire body to form an outer tread of the tire that is of raised relation to all other non-treaded areas of the tire's outer circumference. In other words, the tread ribs64are of further radial extent from the central rotational axis28than the remaining non-treaded areas of the tire's outer circumference. Each tread rib64is elongated in the axial direction of the tire, and each segment40features two such ribs64A,64B. The ribs64are laid out in a staggered pattern, in which sequentially adjacent tread ribs64around the outer circumference of the tire body38alternate between a first position residing adjacent the first side42of the tire body38and a second position residing adjacent the second side44of the tire body38. Accordingly, the two tread ribs64of each segment40originate at the opposing ends40,40B of the segment40so as to reside adjacent the opposing sides42,44of the tire body38in the tire's assembled state. Each rib64slightly crosses the mid-plane PMof the tire body, but terminates well short of the opposing side of the tire body38, preferably spanning less than a quarter of the other half of the tire's axial width.", "", "One particularly unique feature of the inventive tire22is the purposefully novel shape and geometry of the cavities54. In cross-sectional planes that lie normally (orthogonally) of the central rotational axis28, and parallel to the midplane PM, each cavity54has a circumferentially elongated cross-sectional profile. Referring toFIG.7, a length dimension LCof the cavity's cross-sectional profile is measured in a direction of circumferential relationship to the central rotational axis28. This cavity length LCexceeds a lesser width dimension WCof the cavity profile that is measured in a direction of radial relationship to the central rotational axis28. This circumferentially elongated cross-sectional profile of each cavity54, at opposing ends thereof that resides oppositely of one another in the cavity length dimension LC, terminates in concavely rounded terminuses66that are of bulbous relation to a central lengthwise region68of the cavity54that spans between the concavely and bulbously rounded terminuses66. In any given cross-sectional plane of the tire, the cavity width WCis greater at a widest point of each of the bulbously rounded terminuses66than it is at the central lengthwise region68, throughout which the cavity width WCis uniform in said any given cross-sectional plane. As can be visually appreciated from the figures, the cross-sectional profile of each cavity54is thus dumbbell shaped, as can be seen from either end40A,40B of each tire segment40(i.e. from either side42,44of the tire22).", "", "Each cavity has this dumbbell-shaped profile at each cross-sectional plane through the full axial width of the tire. However, the cross-sectional area of the dumbbell-shaped profile is not uniform throughout the axial width of the tire, particularly owing to a variability in the cavity width WCamong the different cross-sectional planes. More specifically, the cavity width WCis tapered in an axially inward direction from each of the two ends40A,40B of the segment40(i.e. from each of the two sides42,44of the tire22) toward the midplane PMof the tire. The cavity width WCof each tapered cavity54is thus at a minimum at the tire's midplane PM. This tapering of the cavity width WCin symmetric fashion from each end of the tire segment toward a minimum cavity width AT the midplane PM, is best shown in the cross-sectioned segment40ofFIG.10, where the segment has been cross-sectioned in a plane of radial, not orthogonal, relation to the rotational axis28of the tire22. It can be seen that the cavity width WC, while at its minimum at the midplane PMof the tire, is at its greatest at the two axially opposing ends40A,40B of the segment, i.e. at each of two axially opposing faces or sides42,44of the assembled tire body38. Specifically purposeful benefits of this tapered cavity width, and the bulbously rounded ends of the dumbbell-shaped cavity profile, are detailed herein further below in relation to rolling movement of the tire during operation of an in-field irrigator10on which tires of this novel design are installed.", "", "The concave inner surface48of each tire segment40has a uniform arcuate profile for flush seating thereof against the corresponding arcuate curvature of the outer surface of the wheel rim's outer drum26. The convex outer surface46, at non-treaded areas thereof between the raised tread ribs64A,64B is not of uniform profile however, and instead features variation in terms of the surface's radial measure from the center-point of its convex curvature, which coincides with the rotational axis28of the wheel. Tread rib64A of each tire segment40is referred to as a first tread rib64A that resides nearest to a first side50of the tread segment40, and the other tread rib64B is thus referred to as a second tread rib6B that resides nearest to an opposing second side52of the tread segment40. Each tire segment40has a first sloped area70A that, in the circumferential direction of the tire22, spans from the first side50of the tire segment40to the second tread rib64B, and a second sloped area70B that spans from the second side52of the tire segment to the first tread rib64A. In the axial direction of the tire22, each sloped area70A,70B spans toward the midplane PMfrom a respective one of the segment's two opposing ends40A,40B, and more particularly from the same end40A,40B thereof adjacent to which the respective tread rib64A,64B resides. So, the first sloped area70A spans toward the midplane PMfrom a same first end40A of the tire segment40as the first tread rib64A, but stops short of the midplane, unlike the first tread rib64A that spans a short distance past the midplane. Likewise, the second sloped area70B spans toward the midplane PMfrom a same second end40B of the tire segment40as the second tread rib64B, but stops short of the midplane, unlike the second tread rib64B that spans a short distance past the midplane.", "", "From the rotational axis28, the radial measure of the outer surface46of the tire segment40at each of the sloped areas70A,70B thereof decreases, at a linear slope, in the axially inward direction toward the midplane PM. In the circumferential direction of the tire, the radial measure of the sloped areas70A,70B is uniform in each cross-sectional plane lying orthogonally of the central rotational axis28, thus imparting an arcuately curved profile to each sloped area in such cross-sectional planes. The first and second sloped areas70A,70B have the same angle of slope, and are separated from one another by a raised central area72of the tire's outer surface46that spans fully from the first side50of the segment40to the opposing second side52thereof. The radial measure the segment's outer surface46from the rotational axis28is less at the raised central area72than at the even more greatly raised tread ribs64A,64B, but is greater at the raised central area72than at the neighbouring inner end regions of the sloped areas70A,70B that resides immediately adjacent the central area72on opposing sides thereof.", "", "In the assembled state of the tire, the raised central areas72of the tire segments40thus cooperatively form a singular circumferential rib of the tire that spans around the full circumference thereof in an axially-central location at the tire's midplane PM. In the assembled state of the tire, the first sloped areas70A of the segments40all reside on a first half of the tire's axial width between the first tread ribs64A on that same first half of the tire, and the second sloped areas70B of the segments40all reside on a second half of the tire's axial width between the second tread ribs64B that occupy that same second half of the tire. The radial measure of the tire's outer circumference at the raised central area72is uniform across a substantial entirety of its axial width, as is the radial measure of the outermost tip of each tread rib64A,64B, though each tread rib64A,64B may terminate with an obliquely sloped outer end80of steep angle near the respective40A,40B end of the segment40, rather than a hard right angle, as best shown inFIG.8.", "", "In the illustrated example, each tread rib64A,64B is offset a short distance from the nearest respective side50,52of the tire segment40. The first end50includes a first sloped end portion74A that spans from the first end40A of the tire segment40to the raised central area72, and at which the radial measure of the outer surface46of the segment slopes in matching profile to the second sloped area70B that resides across the first tread rib64A from this first sloped end portion74A. In the assembled state of two adjacent tire segments40, the first sloped end portion74A of one segment aligns and fits in mating fashion with the second sloped area70B of the other segment, whereby a substantial entirety of the space between the first tread ribs64A of the two segments is of the sloped profile of reducing radial measure in the axially inward direction toward the midplane PM. Likewise, the second end52of each tire segment40includes a second sloped end portion74B that spans from the second end40B of the tire segment40to the raised central area72, and at which the radial measure of the outer surface46slopes in matching fashion to the first sloped area70A that resides across the second tread rib64B from this second sloped end portion74B. In the assembled state of two adjacent tire segments40, the second sloped end portion74B of one segment aligns and fits in mating fashion with the first sloped area70A of the other segment, whereby a substantial entirety of the space between the second tread ribs64B of the two segments is of the sloped profile of reducing radial measure in the axially inward direction toward the midplane PM.", "", "The raised central areas72of the tire segments40, and the resulting centered circumferential rib of the assembled tire, occupy an axial mid-zone of the tire that straddles the midplane PMat which the narrowest point of each hollow cavity54also resides. In other words, the axial midpoint of each cavity at which the cavity width WCis at its minimum coincides with the raised central area72of the respective tire segment, which overlies this narrowest midpoint of the cavity54. In a default uncompressed state of each tire segment40, in which the respective hollow cavity54therein is uncollapsed, this minimum cavity width WCat the cavity's axial midpoint has a non-zero value, meaning that the cavity remains open at this axial midpoint. During rolling movement of each non-pneumatic tire of the center-pivot irrigator10over the field, the tire segments40sequentially move through a lowermost ground-contacting point of a circular rotational path of the tire, i.e. move through a point of under-center relation to the rotational axis28.", "", "During each tire segment's movement through this lowermost under-center point of the tire's rotational path, the tire segment40is pressed into engagement with the ground under the exerted weight of the irrigator10, and the relatively narrow tread ribs64A,64B sink into the ground surface. Among the untreaded areas of the segment's outer surface46that are unoccupied by the discretely spaced tread ribs64A,64B, the raised central area72is pressed against the ground before the radially lesser inner end regions of the sloped areas70A,70B between the treads, whereby the weight of the irrigator is initially concentrated on the raised central area72. This concentrated exertion of the irrigator's weight on the raised central area72causes full radial collapse of the hollow cavity54specifically at the narrow axial midpoint thereof where the cavity width WCwas previously at a default non-zero minimum. This radial collapse of the hollow cavity down to a zero width (i.e. full radial closure) at its axial midpoint triggers a middle-out squeezing action, where field mud that may have accumulated within the cavity54is squeezed outwardly away from the collapsed cavity midpoint, and is thus ejected outwardly through the open ends of the cavity at the opposing sides42,44of the tire32. The uniquely designed tire segments40are thus self-cleaning due to this squeezed ejection of accumulated mud from the segment cavities as they move through the under-center point of the tire's rotational path. The preferred dumbbell-shaped profile imparted by the bulbously rounded ends of the otherwise narrow, circumferentially elongated slot-like cavities54imparts an improved wear-life to the tire segments40by avoiding squared-off corners at the ends of the elongate cavities54, which may otherwise serve as premature stress-failure points under the ongoing cyclical collapse and re-expansion of the slots during rolling travel of the tires.", "", "Meanwhile, owing to the sloped areas70A,70B between the tread ribs64A,64B, the tire also performs an automated rut-mitigation function during rolling movement of the tire segments40through the under-center point of the tire's rotational path.
