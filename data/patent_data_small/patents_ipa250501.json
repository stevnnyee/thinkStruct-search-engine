While tension suspension and compression suspension may be considered equivalent, tension suspension may be particularly advantageous over compression suspension, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.", "", "Another assembly technique may include applying a higher charge pressure (e.g., about 10% more) at the piston-side to center the piston52at about the half-stroke position. This results in there being no initial load on the gas spring50at the wheel assembly30and facilitates assembly without the temporary fixing within a jig. Thus, the wheel assembly30may be considered to be neither pre-stressed, nor pre-compressed, but neutral. For example, a higher full-bore side chamber pressure may be applied (e.g., about 10% higher) than the piston side chamber pressure. Gas may be released from the full-bore side chamber until the piston52becomes centered relative to full-stroke. Alternatively, a higher piston-side chamber pressure may be applied (e.g., about 10% higher) than the full-bore side chamber pressure. Releasing gas from the cylinder51may be considered easier than surcharging, however, this may use more gas (e.g., nitrogen) than other approaches resulting in an increased cost.", "", "The wheel assembly30also includes inboard lateral stops44carried by an inboard surface of the outer rim33.
