However, this is only exemplary and any number of band assemblies55are within the scope of the present invention. In this embodiment, the fiber reinforced polymer assemblies53extend vertically from a bead member58to the vertically adjacent SMA element52or tube. In another embodiment, the fiber reinforced polymer assemblies53can extend diagonally or at an angle from a bead member58to an SMA element52that is not vertically adjacent. For example, when viewingFIG.13, the fiber reinforced polymer assembly53associated with the left-most bead member58may extend upwardly to the right at an angle and extend or wrap around the SMA element that is second from the left or any of the other SMA elements that are not directly vertically adjacent thereto. This arrangement can help address lateral forces in the tire assembly when the vehicle goes around a corner. In another embodiment, a fiber reinforced polymer assembly53can extend around one or bead members58at the ID and one or more SMA elements52at the OD. Different arrangements of band assemblies55including any number of bead members58and any number of SMA elements52and at any angle are within the scope of the present invention.", "", "Further to the explanation involving more than one SMA element,FIG.14shows band assemblies55that include two SMA elements52toward the outside of the tire assembly (near the tread) and one bead member58toward the inside of the tire assembly (near the rim).FIG.15includes exaggerated layering to see that a fiber reinforcement member56inside the polymer member54and extending around the outer surfaces52aand58aof the first and second SMA elements52and the bead member58. As shown inFIG.15, the fiber reinforced polymer assembly may include an extension portion53athat extends inwardly and between the first and second SMA elements52to prevent the SMA elements from rubbing together.FIG.16shows band assemblies55that include three SMA elements52toward the outside of the tire assembly (near the tread) and one bead member58toward the inside of the tire assembly (near the rim). In this arrangement, a portion of the fiber reinforced polymer assembly53extends from the bead member58upwardly at an angle, which provides a lateral force component that helps with cornering and the like. Therefore, if the tire assembly is longitudinally bisected by a plane (e.g., the plane extends up and down with respect to the ground), the right and left sides of the fiber reinforced polymer assembly53extend upwardly at an angle that is non-parallel to the plane. This provides a lateral or horizontal component to the tension provided by the fiber reinforced polymer assembly53.

During loading, the SMA elements52deflect to generate a footprint. The diameter of the remaining SMA elements attempts to grow to accommodate the shortened chord length of the footprint section. The fiber reinforced polymer assembly53restricts the growth of the outer diameter through the semi-rigid fiber reinforcements56wrapped around the SMA elements52to the tire bead elements or members58and/or the rim18. This effectively distributes the load to the entire band assemblies55, rather than just the SMA elements at the footprint, resulting in an efficient usage of the SMA material and improved tire performance. As load is placed on the axle, the SMA elements at or near the outer diameter (OD) of the tire assembly deflect to generate the footprint. Since the circumference is shorter due to the cord length of the footprint, the circumferential tube formed by the SMA elements attempts to grow radially outwardly and/or outside the footprint. The reinforcement fibers56extending between and attaching the rim/beads and the SMA elements restricts the OD growth, therefore generating a semi-rigid body similar to a pneumatic tire.", "", "The tire belt(s)60are used to support tire assembly performance with added lateral strength.
