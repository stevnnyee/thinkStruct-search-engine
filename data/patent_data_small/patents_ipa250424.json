Conventional wheel100comprises hub102, spokes104and rim106. Conventional spoked wheels are generally stable in crosswinds and, depending on the materials used in their manufacture, can be lightweight and stiff. However, as discussed above, a major source of drag on a bicycle results from the flow of air over and around the cycling wheels and given the aerodynamic complexity of such cycling wheels, a wheel with improved aerodynamics is desirable.", "", "Typical attempts to reduce drag have focused on the use of rigid materials and structures, with a view to providing the structural stability of conventional cycling wheels but with improved aerodynamic characteristics. Further, to decrease the drag associated with traditional spoked wheels, wheels with rims of significant depth and disc wheels have been developed, and deeper depth rims offer significantly greater aerodynamic savings but at a cost to perceived rider stability. However, the inventors have developed a vehicle wheel and vehicle wheel accessories with improved aerodynamics, that do not necessarily rely on rigid materials or structures, and without compromising rider stability.", "", "Attention is directed toFIG.2A, which depicts a side view of cycling wheel200having an accessory205, according to non-limiting embodiments. Cycling wheel200comprises hub202, a plurality of spokes204connected thereto, an outer rim206and inner rim208. Inner rim208is located at a radial distance, D, away from hub202(radially inward of the outer rim206). The radial distance D may vary. For example, according to some embodiments, radial distance D is in a range of about 1% to about 99% of a total radial distance, R, from the outer rim to the inner rim. According to some embodiments, D is in a range of about 25 to about 30% R. According to some embodiments, D is about 40 mm or about 60 mm or about 90 mm. In traditional deep dish wheels (which are stiff), the greater the radial size of the deep dish, the better the resulting aerodynamic characteristics (due to reduced drag). However, in practice the radial distance of the deep dish usually remains much less than the maximum radius of wheel, especially if the accessory is installed on the front wheel of the bicycle (and therefore the steering column) because a full deep-dish configuration (where the dish radial length is equal to the maximum radius) would typically pose a stability/safety risk if the rider's front wheel is hit by a sudden gust of wind. In contrast, the Applicant has found that wheels having the accessories described herein usually exhibit good stability and safety in crosswinds even if D is \u02dc due to, at least in part, to the ability for components of the accessories to adapt to external forces and change shape, absorbing at least some of the external forces/winds loads and reducing the aerodynamic loads experienced by the rider. As a result, wheels having the accessories described herein are not usually limited in the same way as a traditional deep dish wheel and can usually have deeper radial section without compromising on rider safety and stability.", "", "Cycling wheel200further comprises accessory205having an adaptable circumferential membrane210configured to be coupled to the inner rim208and the outer rim206via at least one attachment assembly that is configured to operatively couple accessory205to wheel200as an overlay to structural elements, such as one or more of spokes204, coupling hub202to tire203. Adaptable circumferential membrane210is structurally configured to adapt to an external force and change shape when subjected to external forces. For example, adaptable circumferential membrane210may be configured to deform under an external force, such as a crosswind, with the ability to return to a neutral position once the external force is no longer present or is at or below a predetermined threshold. Adaptable circumferential membrane210is configured to function similarly to an airfoil that changes in camber based on the direction and magnitude of the external force. According to some embodiments, membrane210comprises one or more extensible materials, such as shrink-wrapped polymer, silicone, latex, stretch film, elastic/stretchable fabric and/or rubber. Any suitable material or suitable combination of materials for the adaptable circumferential membrane is contemplated.", "", "According to some embodiments, adaptable circumferential membrane210comprises at least one air engaging flexible and aerodynamic surface overlaying at least some structural elements that couple the hub to the tire, such as first air engaging flexible and aerodynamic surface210A and second sir engaging flexible and aerodynamic surface210B (also referred to herein as aerodynamic surface210A and aerodynamic surface201B) (see, for example,FIGS.2B and2C). Aerodynamic surfaces210A,210B are configured to deform and/or change shape when wheel200, and therefore also the aerodynamic surfaces201A,201B, is subjected to an external force, E (which may be an external wind force). Such deformation and change in shape is demonstrative of, at least in part, the aerodynamic surfaces' ability to adapt to an external force. Through this adaptation, the aerodynamic surfaces210A and210B usually creates a resulting high side of the airfoil, which generates lift and resulting thrust.", "", "According to some embodiments, one or more of aerodynamic surfaces210are installed under tension (\u201ctension\u201d being defined herein as a pulling force/tensile load on a material). For example, according to some embodiments, each of aerodynamic surfaces210A,210B are under the same first or initial tensile load. According to some embodiments, aerodynamic surface210A is under a different tensile load to aerodynamic surface210B. According to some embodiments, the first or initial tensile load is in a range to yield about 1% to about 80% elongation, 0.5% to about 20% elongation, or from about 15% to about 20% elongation of the respective aerodynamic surface in a radial direction. According to some embodiments, the first or initial tensile load is about 40 psi or less. According to some embodiments, the first or initial tensile load is in a range of about 0.4 ksi to about 740 ksi. In placing the aerodynamic surfaces210A,210B under an initial tension, the thickness of the material and its inherent stiffness is usually taken into account. The Applicant has found that if the combined material stiffness and pre-tension is too low, then the dynamic shape of the surface may bulge out, resulting in reduced aerodynamics. At the other extreme, if the combined material stiffness and pre-tension is too high then the aerodynamic surfaces210A,210B of the adaptable circumferential membrane are usually unable to morph and change shape in a manner to improve or obtain the desired improvement in aerodynamics with the result being reduced or no performance gain over a traditional rigid wheel.", "", "Any suitable materials or combination of materials for the adaptable circumferential membrane and the aerodynamic surfaces are contemplated. For example, according to some embodiments, the adaptable circumferential membrane and the aerodynamic surfaces comprise one or more of: a polyester film, a polyolefin film and a rubber. According to some embodiments, the polyester film and/or the polyolefin film is of a thickness of about 0.025 mm to about 1.50 mm, and the first or initial tensile load is in a range to yield about 1% to about 89% elongation in a radial direction. According to some embodiments, the rubber is of a thickness of about 0.15 mm to about 0.25 mm, and the first or initial tensile load is in a range to yield about 1% to about 600% elongation in a radial direction.", "", "As noted above, according to some embodiments, the aerodynamic surfaces are under different tensile loads or under the same tensile loads. The inclusion of symmetrical or asymmetrical tensile loads may depend on whether the accessory is being installed on the front wheel or the rear wheel of the bicycle. For example, the spoke angles are usually symmetrical on the drive side and non-drive side of the wheel, whereas the spoke angles of a rear wheel on the drive side and non-drive side are usually different because the gear cluster is on the drive side. According to some embodiments, the tension of each aerodynamic surface can be individually adjusted and/or selected to allow the inner rim to maintain a neutral/centered position directly below/in-line with the outer rim.", "", "Each of the aerodynamic surfaces210A,210B has a radially medial perimeter edge and a radially distal perimeter edge, such as radially medial perimeter edges216(also referred to as radially medial perimeter edge216A in respect of aerodynamic surface210A and as radially medial perimeter edge216B in respect of aerodynamic surface210B) and radially distal perimeter edges218(also referred to as radially distal perimeter edge218A in respect of aerodynamic surface210A and as radially distal perimeter edge218B in respect of aerodynamic surface210B). The radially medial perimeter edges are each configured to be operatively connected to the inner rim, such as inner rim208, and the radially distal perimeter edges are each configured to be operatively connected to the outer rim, such as outer rim206. Each of aerodynamics surfaces210A,210B forms an axial surface of the wheel when coupled thereto (see, for example, first axial surface211A and second axial surface211B, collectively referred to herein as axial surfaces211). According to some embodiments, the axial surfaces211are configured to yield an attached boundary layer. According to some embodiments, axial surfaces211are enabled to morph/change shape and move with the airflow over the wheel, which helps the boundary layer to remain attached to the axial surface rather than separate and become turbulent (which would result in additional drag forces). The longer the boundary layer of the airflow is able to stay attached to the axial surfaces (over a greater length of the surface in the direction of airflow), usually the better the resulting aerodynamic characteristics of the wheel.", "", "As discussed above, the accessory described herein comprises an attachment assembly configured to operatively couple the adaptable circumferential membrane to the outer rim and the inner rim as an overlay to wheel structural elements coupling the hub to the tire. Any suitable manner of operatively coupling the adaptable circumferential membrane to the outer rim and the inner rim is contemplated.

Whilst the handle (fastening element32) penetrates the through opening24of the covering panel22, the handle is free to rotate inside the covering panel22. The covering panel22comprises coupling elements such as, for example, clips52(FIG.7) by which the second fastening element32is held in the through opening24and on the covering panel22in said moving direction and thus in the axial direction of the wheel14.

The determination section132reads the vehicle management database from the storage12and extracts the mounted position information and the mounted tire information of the tire30based on the identifier. The determination section132determines abnormal internal pressure of the tire30based on the internal pressure and the temperature of the mounted tire information. Here, the temperature is used in temperature compensation to convert the internal pressure of the tire30to a value at a specific temperature. A known method may be used for temperature compensation. The determination section132may, for example, determine that the tire30has abnormal internal pressure when the internal pressure of the tire30after compensation is less than a reference value. The reference value may be a constant value, and may be a different value for different types of the tires30. Further, a method for determining the presence or absence of abnormal internal pressure is not limited to use of the reference value, and may be any other known method.", "", "When the tire30has an abnormal internal pressure, the determination section132determines the degree of the abnormal internal pressure. The degree of the abnormal internal pressure is divided into three classifications according to the present embodiment, but the number of classifications is not limited to three. A first classification is a state that requires emergency maintenance to replace the tire30, such as a puncture. Hereinafter, the first classification is also referred to as \u201cpuncture\u201d. When the abnormal internal pressure is that of a puncture, the risk of continued operation of the vehicle20is high, and stopping and calling for road service is preferable. A second classification is a state where the tire30is deflating at a rate faster than natural pressure drop, although not as fast as a puncture, such as a case of a sharp object such as a nail being stuck in the tire and not released or in a case of a valve failure. Hereinafter, the second classification is also referred to as \u201cslow leak\u201d. When the abnormal internal pressure is that of a slow leak, the risk of continued operation of the vehicle20is moderate, and travel to a maintenance provider may be possible. A third classification is a state where the tire30is deflating at approximately the same rate as natural pressure drop. Hereinafter, the third classification is also referred to as \u201cnatural pressure drop\u201d. When the abnormal internal pressure is that of a natural pressure drop, the risk of continued operation of the vehicle20is low and continued vehicle operation is basically possible.", "", "When the tire30has an abnormal internal pressure, the determination section132determines the degree of the abnormal internal pressure based on the value of the internal pressure of the tire30. For example, when the internal pressure of the tire30is significantly low, the determination section132is able to determine that the abnormal internal pressure is that of a puncture. However, determining the classification based solely on the value of the internal pressure of the tire30may be difficult. The determination section132may determine the degree of the abnormal internal pressure of the tire30based on the value of the internal pressure of the tire30and the pressure drop rate. The determination section132may calculate the pressure drop rate based on the time series data of the internal pressure and determine whether the abnormal internal pressure is that of a puncture, slow leak, or natural pressure drop based on the pressure drop rate. Further, the determination section132may determine the pressure drop rate by comparing the internal pressure change with other tires on the same axle, for example. The vehicle20and the operation management device60are notified of the degree of abnormal internal pressure determined as the abnormal internal pressure determination result, together with the mounted position information of the tire30that has been determined to have an abnormal internal pressure. A driver of the vehicle20and a manager of the operation management device60are not simply notified that there is abnormal internal pressure, as in conventional technology, but receive information on the degree of the abnormal internal pressure and the mounted position, making judging whether vehicle operation may continue easier. For example, when a driver or manager is only notified of abnormal internal pressure using conventional technology, the driver or manager has little choice but to stop the vehicle promptly in order to prevent an accident. According to the present embodiment, a driver or manager may judge, for example, that vehicle operation may be able to continue to a nearby maintenance provider based on the information that the degree of abnormal internal pressure in the tire30is that of a slow leak and the mounted position is an inside wheel of a dual wheel.", "", "Here, the risk of continued operation of the vehicle20may vary depending on the state of the vehicle20and the tire30in which abnormal internal pressure occurred. The risk evaluation section134evaluates the risk of continued travel of the vehicle20based on the mounted position and the abnormal internal pressure determination result of the tire30that has been determined to have an abnormal internal pressure. Here, the abnormal internal pressure determination result is the degree of the abnormal internal pressure determined by the determination section132.", "", "The risk evaluation section134first evaluates the magnitude of risk according to the degree of the abnormal internal pressure. That is, the risk evaluation section134evaluates the risk as high, moderate, or low when the degree of abnormal internal pressure is that of a puncture, slow leak, or natural pressure drop, respectively. Hereinafter, an evaluation based solely on the degree of the abnormal internal pressure may be referred to as an \u201cinitial evaluation\u201d. The risk evaluation section134further takes into account other factors to alter the risk evaluation. The risk evaluation section134evaluates risk as high when, for example, the mounted position of the tire30in which the abnormal internal pressure occurred is not an inside wheel of a dual wheel (rear left inside wheel or rear right inside wheel). In other words, the risk evaluation section134maintains the \u201cinitial evaluation\u201d when, for example, the mounted position of the tire30in which the abnormal internal pressure occurred is an inside wheel of a dual wheel, and otherwise sets the evaluation to \u201chigh risk\u201d.", "", "Further, the risk evaluation section134may set the evaluation to \u201chigh risk\u201d upon determining from the load information of the vehicle20that the vehicle20is heavier than a defined weight. Further, the risk evaluation section134may set the evaluation to \u201chigh risk\u201d when an estimated distance to a destination is longer than a defined distance or when an estimated time to the destination is longer than a defined time, based on the travel route of the vehicle20. Further, the risk evaluation section134may set the evaluation to \u201chigh risk\u201d when the vehicle20is scheduled to use a highway, based on the travel route of the vehicle20. The vehicle20and the operation management device60are notified of the evaluation by the risk evaluation section134. A driver of the vehicle20and a manager of the operation management device60may refer to the objective risk evaluation to judge whether or not to continue appropriate vehicle operation.", "", "In the same example as above, suppose that a driver and a manager receive information that the degree of abnormal internal pressure in the tire30is that of a slow leak and the mounted position is an inside wheel of a dual wheel, and the risk evaluation section134evaluates the risk as \u201chigh risk\u201d because vehicle20is heavier than the defined weight.

Continuing to notify the vehicle20after a final decision has been made may cause driver anxiety due to alarms such as a warning lamp, for example. The notification section133stops output to the vehicle20upon acquiring a signal from the operation management device60indicating that a response to the abnormal internal pressure of the tire30has been decided. Such a stop to processing may eliminate driver anxiety caused by continuation of an alarm based on a notification.", "", "The notification section133may further change at least one of notification method or notification interval based on the evaluation by the risk evaluation section134. The notification section133may, for example, shorten the notification interval when the evaluation is \u201chigh risk\u201d and repeat the notification until a command to stop is received from the notification destination. Further, the notification section133may, for example, cause an alarm to be executed using a combination of a warning lamp and a warning speaker when the evaluation is \u201chigh risk\u201d. The notification section133may, for example, increase the notification interval to, for example, once every30minutes when the evaluation is \u201cmoderate risk\u201d. Further, the notification section133may, for example, cause an alarm to be executed using only a warning lamp when the evaluation is \u201cmoderate risk\u201d.
