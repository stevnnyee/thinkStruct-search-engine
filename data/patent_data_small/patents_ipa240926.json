Spoke hole width122allows the portion of nipple190around nipple opening192to pass through spoke hole120, but does not allow collar196to pass through spoke hole120, such that nipple is retained in spoke hole120by the tension of spoke150on nipple190once tube170is threaded into nipple190.FIG.3also shows spoke threads174which inter-engage with nipple threads194to thread tube170into nipple190.

However, because each spoke150extends at angle250to plane230, each spoke150extends from its tube170at angle250to tube axis172. This means that there is a bend in spoke150at an angle250at the point320where spoke150protrudes from tube170. With steel spokes, such a bend would weaken the spoke and ultimately cause the spoke to fail. However, with spokes150, such a bend does not damage spokes150, because fibers152are flexible and resilient yet strong such that spokes150retain their integrity and strength even when bent under tension in the manner described. Therefore, spokes150can bend without weakening or failing. Furthermore, each of spokes150is three times as strong, and weighs half as much, as a steel spoke that would otherwise be used in its place. This allows the width158of each of spokes150to be greater than that of a steel spoke that would be used in its place. In the alternative, the width158of each spoke150may be less than or equal to the width of a steel spoke that would be used in its place; the strength of each of spokes150may be greater or less than three times that of a steel spoke that would be used in its place; and the weight of each of spokes150may be greater or less than half that of a steel spoke that would be used in its place.", "", "Rim110, hub130, tube170, anchor180and nipple190, in a preferred embodiment, are made of aluminum.

In addition, triplex cords regularly have a comparatively high thickness, which in the later operation of the vehicle tire is perceived as a disadvantage with respect to the temperature development and thus also ultimately the high-speed performance. In addition, the hysteresis characteristics of such triplex cords in some cases worsen the rolling resistance of the corresponding vehicle tires.", "", "As an alternative to triplex cords, the prior art also discloses what are known as duplex cords, in which only two yarns are twisted together and which are therefore much simpler to produce. Duplex cords are also frequently thinner than triplex cords here.
