The vehicle system may include at least one propulsion-generating vehicle and optionally, one or more non-propulsion-generating vehicles. Alternatively, the vehicle system may be formed of only a single propulsion-generating vehicle, multiple propulsion-generating vehicles, a single non-propulsion-generating vehicle, or multiple non-propulsion-generating vehicles. The vehicles included in the vehicle system may be mechanically coupled with each other or may be mechanically separate (but coordinate movements with each other so that the separate vehicles travel together, such as in a convoy).", "", "The propulsion-generating vehicle may generate tractive efforts to propel (for example, pull or push) the vehicle system along routes. The propulsion-generating vehicle can include a propulsion subsystem, such as an engine, one or more traction motors, and/or the like, which operate to generate tractive effort to propel the vehicle system.", "", "In the example ofFIG.1, the vehicle may include wheels120that engage the route and at least one axle122that couples left and right wheels together. Optionally, the wheels and axles may be located on one or more trucks or bogies118. Optionally, the trucks may be fixed-axle trucks, such that the wheels can be rotationally fixed to the axles, so the left wheel rotates the same speed, amount, and at the same times as the right wheel. In one embodiment, the vehicle system may not include axles, such as in some mining vehicles, electric vehicles, etc.", "", "The vehicle system may also include a braking assembly124that may be coupled to at least one of the wheels of the vehicle system.

In one example, each of the segments can include a friction surface that may engage the wheel to slow or stop rotation of the wheel, where the segments may engage and contact the wheel and apply a braking torque on the wheel. Alternatively, one or more (but less than all) of the segments may not include the friction surface. Each segment can be separated from the neighboring segments by channels208.

In one example, the brake disc ofFIGS.3through6Bmay be the brake disc shown inFIG.2. Each individual brake disc may include a friction surface304and fin elements306. The friction surface can be used for engaging a braking lining to provide torque on the wheel to decelerate or stop the wheel. The fin elements may be radially elongated fins that can be longer generally or substantially along radial directions extending outward from the rotation axis of the wheel. In the illustrated example, the fin elements may include curved portions that do not extend along the radial directions, but that can be longer along or parallel to these radial directions than other, non-radial directions. The fin elements may increase inertia of the brake disc by preventing or reducing tendencies of the brake disc to rotate or move relative to the vehicle.", "", "Each segment may also include one or more channels308for receiving fastening assemblies303. In particular, each segment can include an opening309for receiving a fastener, and partial openings311at each end of the segment that may be adjacent to another segment. The partial openings meet at the channel, and a fastening assembly313(shown inFIG.6A) can be placed for providing additional force for coupling the segments together. For example, the openings309may be surrounded by the body of the segment, while the partial openings may be partially surrounded by the body of the segment (with each partial opening defining half or less than half of the entire opening). The partial openings in neighboring segments may face each other while the segments may be disposed next to each other, as shown inFIG.3. As a result of the fastening assembly, fewer brake segments may be required, thereby potentially reducing the required components.", "", "Each segment also may include segment fasteners323that, in one example, can be pin elements that extend through the channel and may be received within corresponding cavities325of an adjacent segment. These segment fasteners can be elongated pins that can be oriented in or along circumferential directions extending around the axis of rotation of the wheel. For example, the segment fasteners can be elongated pins protruding from a surface400of the segment in directions that may be along or tangential to circumferences around the axis of rotation of the wheel.

The first arcuate surface can define a perimeter of the first wing around the first opening that may terminate at the second face. Similarly, the second arcuate surface can define a perimeter of the second wing around the second opening that can terminate at the second face as well. Thus, the second face may be located between the first wing and the second wing. The second face may be in parallel spaced relation to the first face and can define a flat edge on an outermost surface of the first bracket. In this manner, the flat edge of the second face may be configured to receive and/or engage a portion of a fastening device350that may include numerous components such as a washer359, a head357of a bolt, or the like.

Within the second bracket and disposed through the third face can be a second bracket bore335that aligns with wheel bore and can be configured to receive at least one component of the fastening device. The second bracket may also include a second tapered section339that extends from the third face outwardly away from the wheel web and tapers to increase in diameter the further away the second tapered section is away from the wheel web.

In yet another example, the third wing and fourth wing may have a combination of arcuate portions and linear portions. To this end, the third wing may be symmetrical to the fourth wing along, about, or across a central axis of the wheel bore. In another example, the third wing may be asymmetrical. The third wing and fourth wing may be spaced from the wheel web and can be configured to define a location in which a third opening348(e.g., within the third wing) and the fourth opening349(e.g., within the fourth wing) can be located. In particular, the third opening and fourth opening can each receive the segment fasteners of a corresponding segment to couple the segment to the wheel web. Alternatively, the second bracket does not receive a segment fastener and can be utilized only as a securing bracket for providing compression between the first bracket and second bracket.

To this end, the central section can bulge past each of the first end section and the second end section. In addition, the central section may be slightly smaller in diameter than the wheel bore causing an arcuate gap to be provided between the central section and the wheel web. By having the arcuate gap, the central section can expand to engage the wheel web to provide additional securing forces between the brake disc and the wheel under loading conditions while the heat within the wheel increases.", "", "The fastening device also can include a fastening element355. The fastening element can extend through the first bracket, through the wheel web and through the second bracket.

As a result of the shaft of the fastening element tapering to increase the diameter of the shaft at each end, an increased diameter may be provided for the head and nut. The increased diameter can result in a greater surface area of the head and nut that compress against the first bracket and second bracket accordingly.

Under heated conditions, the sliding pin may increase or expand in size to engage the surface of the wheel bore. In this manner, additional forces are presented to hold the segmented brake disc in place during a braking condition. In this manner, a segmented brake disc can be provided with fastener assemblies that can enhance securing force between segments of the brake disc and the wheel.
