The hub portion23of the illustrated composite wheel10includes six attachment apertures24through which the wheels studs14of the wheel mount12are inserted when the wheel10is mounted on the wheel mount12.

The fastening aperture42also includes a central fastening axis X. The fastening axis X of the fastening aperture42and internal bore25of the fastening nut18are aligned when the bearing body21and nut are in use, as shown inFIG.3. In use, the fastening aperture42receives a wheel stud14of the wheel mount12(FIG.1).", "", "The bearing body21is used to distribute clamping force F (FIGS.4and5) across the surface47of the composite wheel10around the attachment aperture24. To achieve this, the head38of the bearing body21includes a substantially flat base44configured to face and abut the surface of the composite wheel10about the attachment aperture24. The head38of the bearing body21is therefore configured to provide an increased clamping contact area with the load transfer zone45of the surface47of the composite wheel10surrounding the attachment aperture24and thereby increase the area through which the clamping force is applied to that area.", "", "Additionally, the bearing body21is configured to receive the fastening nut18in nut aperture27so that the engagement portion36of the fastening nut21engages with the engagement surface30in insert section40. The nut aperture27comprises a circular or polygonal shaped recess sized to accommodate the fastening nut18, with some clearance, to allow the fastening nut18to be manipulated in that recess. In some embodiments, that clearance is sufficient to also accommodate a portion of tool (not illustrated) used to manipulate the fastening nut18, for example a socket wrench or spanner. As shown inFIG.3, the nut aperture27forms a recess that then steps into the fastening aperture42.", "", "The insert section40of the bearing body21is designed to transfer the clamping force from the engagement surface30through to the bearing body21and base44thereof.

The insert section40is configured to extend into an attachment aperture24of the composite wheel10. The radial cross-section of body50of the insert section40is circular. Furthermore, the radial width of the body50of the insert section40is smaller than the radial width of the attachment aperture24. This forms a radial gap G (FIG.4) between the outside of the body50of the insert section40and the internal sides of attachment aperture24in the composite wheel10. This reduces the possibility of the insert section40transferring some of the clamping load to the walls of the attachment aperture24and also provides clearance for a degree of expansion of the insert section40within the attachment aperture24.", "", "The thickness and radial width of the insert section40is sufficient to connect to the nut aperture27of the bearing body21, accommodate the fastening aperture42and the engagement surface36, as well as provide sufficient material to enable force transfer from the engagement surface30to the base44of the bearing body21. This can result is a significant outer diameter for the insert section40. The distal end52of the insert section40therefore includes a smaller diameter extension section53which is axially aligned with the fastening axis X and fastening aperture42which is specifically configured to be received within the insert section aperture54of the backing plate22(see below). The extension section53effectively provides a step in the distal end52of the insert section40where the radial size of the insert section40reduces in size to match the size of the insert section aperture54of the backing plate22.

This configuration positions the fastening nut in a lower position than if the engagement surface30was located within the bearing body21. The engagement portion36of the fastening nut18and the engagement surface30of the insert section40are positioned below the base44of the bearing body21and below the top surface level47of the composite wheel. This positioning enables the attachment arrangement to accommodate shorter elongate fasteners (wheel studs) compared to the arrangement taught in WO2013/000009A1, therefore accommodating a smaller stack height H (FIG.3) than possible in the arrangement taught in WO2013/000009A1. This provides the advantage of retaining standard vehicle wheel stud lengths and wheel nut designs when attaching a composite wheel10to the wheel mount12of a vehicle (not illustrated).", "", "The arrangement of the engagement surface30within the insert section40locates the clamping engagement force between the engagement portion36of the fastening nut18and the engagement surface30of the insert section40below the base44of the bearing body21and the surface47of the composite wheel10around the attachment aperture24. The attachment insert20is configured to project the compressive force from that clamping engagement outwards from the engagement surface30and axially (relative to fastening axis X) back up the insert section40, and to the base44of the bearing body21.
