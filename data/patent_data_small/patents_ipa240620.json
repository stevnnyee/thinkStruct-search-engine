As a result, after the retention of the mobile roller (4b), the wheel (3) can only rotate due to friction from the rotation of the fixed rollers (4a) and the pressure of the rollers (4a,4b) on the edge of the rim (3a) since the rollers (4a,4b) are slightly thicker than the width of the rim (3a).", "", "As shown inFIGS.1A to3and7, the stand (2) of the machine (1) of the invention comprises an inclined front surface (2a) that improves operator ergonomics and minimizes work injuries.

The dispensing system (6) comprises a roll (6a) of tape (5) placed and fixed on an axle (6h) attached to a tensing system (6b) that is located between the wheel (3) and the roll (6a) on the front surface (2a) of the stand (2). The tensing system (6b) of the dispensing system (6) comprises at least three rollers, where at least one tensing roller (6e) has a larger diameter than the other two guide rollers (6f). In other words, the larger diameter tensing roller (6e) will have the purpose of generating tension in the tape (5) to prevent wrinkles and the smaller diameter guide rollers (6f) above and below the tensing roller (6e) are for directing the tape (5) towards the inside of the rim (3a). The tensing roller (6e) that is in contact with the inside of the rim (3a) has the same thickness as the width of the inside of the rim (3a) in order to be inserted into it and fix the tape (5) completely flat. In addition, the dispensing system (6) is capable of moving along the radial guide (6g) and the guide groove (6c) from a resting position until it meets the wheel (3) when activated by a start button (10) on the upper part of the stand (2).", "", "In addition, the dispensing system (6) also comprises a retention system (6d) formed, for example, of a brake disc installed on a rear surface (2b) of the stand (2) connected to the dispensing system (6) to exert a certain dosed retention on the axle (6h) of the roll (6a) as shown inFIGS.3and6. The tape (5) is also placed in the interior of the rim (3a) with the right tension to stick it as strongly and smoothly as possible. This retention system (6d) also has a regulation device to establish the necessary tension of the tape (5). As also shown inFIGS.1A,3and4, the dispensing system (6) is also connected to a mobile, displaceable cutting system (7) next to the dispensing system (6), since once the necessary tape (5) has been fixed to the interior of the rim (3a), the tape (5) must be cut.

The pneumatic piston (7a) moves the blade (7b) perpendicularly, so that the blade (7b) passes through the stand (2) from the rear surface (2b) towards the front surface (2a) through a lower area of the guide groove (6c).

That is to say, the fixed rollers (4a) begin to rotate, which by friction make the wheel (3) rotate and the path established for the overlapping parameter of the tape (5) will rotate over the valve hole. Once sufficient turn has been made for the overlapping of the tape (5), the fixed rollers (4a) stop and a dispensing system (6) moves along a radial guide (6g) of the system (6) thanks to a guide groove (6c) on the stand (2) until a tensing system (6b) in the dispensing system (6), through which the tape (5) protrudes, comes into contact with the wheel (3), specifically with the interior of the rim (3a).
