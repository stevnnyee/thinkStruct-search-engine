A typical overall outer diameter of such a wheel assembly may be 100 inches or greater. The outer rim33may have an increased thickness portion38along an inner circumference thereof.

The weight-reduction openings43may have another shape, such as oblong, hexagonal, and/or contoured for stress reduction, for example.

The gas springs50may be air springs and/or nitrogen springs, for example. The gas springs50may include other gasses as well.", "", "Illustratively, the gas springs50are arranged in pairs on opposite sides of the disk40. More particularly, the gas springs50diverge outwardly from the inner rim31to the outer rim33. A respective attachment bracket53afor each gas spring50is coupled to a respective thickened wall portion42of the disk40, for example, adjacent the inner rim31. Each attachment bracket53amay include a generally U-shaped or V-shaped base bracket that receives an end of the piston52therein (e.g., between the arm of the U- or V-shaped bracket). A fastener fastens the end of the piston52of the gas spring50to the base bracket and thus, each gas spring is coupled adjacent the respective thickened wall portion42of the disk40and adjacent the inner rim31. A similar attachment bracket53bis coupled to the outer rim33adjacent inboard and outboard surfaces. Accordingly, the gas springs50are pivotably coupled between the inner and outer rims31,33.", "", "As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the gas springs50provide a gas suspension for relative movement between the inner rim31and the outer rim33. The gas springs50have an operating stroke the permits the disk40to define a mechanical stop. In other words, the gas springs50maintain the outer rim33spaced apart from the inner rim31. However, if pressure on any gas spring50causes the gas spring to reach its limit under load or the gas spring fails, the disk40may act as a mechanical stop to limit relative movement between the inner and outer rims31,33. In other words, the disk40and gas springs50may considered as providing a run-flat capability.", "", "Initial charge pressures of the gas springs50, for example, when the gas springs are in the form of double-acting gas springs, will now be described, for example, with respect to initial pressures in the wheel assembly30when there are little or no external loads applied thereto (i.e., free-wheel). In particular, the chamber associated with the piston-side of the cylinder51is typically smaller (e.g., by about 10%) than the chamber associated with the full-bore side of the cylinder. Thus, when the piston52is centered within the cylinder51so that there is a relatively equal stroke in tension and compression, the piston-side chamber pressure is higher (e.g., by about 10%) than the full-bore side chamber pressure.", "", "Thus, while equal pressure charging of the double-acting gas cylinder51may be convenient, it results in an offset piston52, which, in turn, results in an offset force to be applied to assemble the gas springs50within the wheel assembly30. To accomplish this, the inner and outer rims31,33may be temporarily fixed in a rigid jig. However, using a rigid jig may make replacement of the gas springs50in the field increasingly difficult. Thus, to address increased ease of in-field replacement of the gas springs50, weld-on rings may be coupled to the inner and outer rims31,33and to turn-buckles to temporarily lock the inner and outer rims in place. A similar arrangement may be used in-shop as well, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.", "", "Accordingly, the result is a pre-stressed inner rim31suspension to the outer rim33. The pre-stressing may ensure that the lateral stops44,45(described below) are not active or under pressure. With different charge pressures, the suspension can be pre-compressed. While tension suspension and compression suspension may be considered equivalent, tension suspension may be particularly advantageous over compression suspension, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.", "", "Another assembly technique may include applying a higher charge pressure (e.g., about 10% more) at the piston-side to center the piston52at about the half-stroke position. This results in there being no initial load on the gas spring50at the wheel assembly30and facilitates assembly without the temporary fixing within a jig. Thus, the wheel assembly30may be considered to be neither pre-stressed, nor pre-compressed, but neutral. For example, a higher full-bore side chamber pressure may be applied (e.g., about 10% higher) than the piston side chamber pressure. Gas may be released from the full-bore side chamber until the piston52becomes centered relative to full-stroke. Alternatively, a higher piston-side chamber pressure may be applied (e.g., about 10% higher) than the full-bore side chamber pressure. Releasing gas from the cylinder51may be considered easier than surcharging, however, this may use more gas (e.g., nitrogen) than other approaches resulting in an increased cost.", "", "The wheel assembly30also includes inboard lateral stops44carried by an inboard surface of the outer rim33. More particularly, the inboard lateral stops44are positioned adjacent the thickened wall portion42. The wheel assembly30also includes outboard lateral stops45carried by an outboard surface of the outer rim33. Similarly to the inboard lateral stops44, the outboard lateral stops45are adjacent the thickened wall portion42. Each thickened wall portion42is positioned between a pair of inboard and outboard lateral stops44,45. The inboard and outboard lateral stops44,45together with the outer rim33may conceptually be considered to be in the form of an L-shaped bracket. Illustratively, the inboard and outboard lateral stops44,45each has a support plate61(e.g., having a rectangular shape) that is transverse to the outer rim33and has triangular side members62.", "", "As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the inboard and outboard lateral stops44,45cooperate to limit relative lateral movement of the disk40and the outer rim33. In other words, turning, for example, of the vehicle20may cause lateral movement of the disk40relative to the outer rim33. The inboard and outboard lateral stops44,45may limit the amount of lateral movement of the disk40relative to the outer rim33to thereby maintain structural integrity of the wheel assembly30.

Approximately half of axle assembly10is shown, with an understanding components and arrangements shown here can be mirrored to the other half to provide for a complete axle assembly10. Axle assembly10is a Salisbury type construction where a pair of axle tubes12are inserted (to the right inFIG.1) in a receiving bore14of carrier housing16at an inboard end18of the assembly. Axle tubes12may be mild steel, while carrier housing16may be a castable aluminum, thereby reducing the mass of axle assembly10. Although this disclosure should not limit the types of material, the use of these dissimilar metals requires new approaches to make such an arrangement successful, including stress reduction and developing a joining method between the carrier housing16and tube12that is different than traditional plug welding used for steel/cast iron designs.", "", "Continuing to refer toFIG.1, but now at the outboard end20of the assembly, the wheel of the vehicle is mounted to outboard facing flange22of wheel hub24. In this \u201cfull floating\u201d wheel end arrangement, wheel hub24is directly supported by tube12via bearings26. Axle shaft30passes through tube12from inboard end18to outboard end20. Axle shaft30transmits axle output power from a differential or geartrain internal to carrier housing16(not shown) to the wheel hub22(which is bolted at the outboard end to the axle shaft30) and onto the attached vehicle wheel. Axle shaft30is connected to wheel hub22at location32. The vehicle wheel (not shown) attaches to wheel hub24. Immediately inboard of wheel hub24is a bracket32which is used to mount brake system components. Further inboard, mounted on the top of axle tube12is spring mount34. Spring mount34supports the chassis frame of the vehicle via leaf or coil type springs (not shown). The load from the chassis, referred to as the chassis load40, is applied to axle tube12through spring mount34and is transferred by the axle tube12to the vehicle's supporting wheels via wheel hub24. Consider that a similar chassis load40will be applied on the other half of axle assembly10not shown. Further inboard from spring mount34on the upper surface of tube12a stop pad36is mounted. Stop pad36provides a surface for a bump stop device to limit suspension travel. At times during the vehicle's operation, the suspension may compress enough to cause contact between the chassis and stop pad36via a compliant/resilient bump stop. Approximately aligned along tube12with stop pad36but fixed to the bottom portion of axle tube12is shock mount38, which receives a shock that is utilized to dampen spring oscillations and provide stability to axle assembly10. Both of these additional interfaces may incur additional load and therefore stress from the chassis into tube12, but the predominant loading that will affect carrier housing16surrounding the interface at receiving bore14is chassis loading40and resultant wheel loads42(shown counter to the chassis load40at the outboard end) as well as the interference fit between axle tube12and carrier housing16.", "", "During operation of the vehicle, and particularly when traveling on a rough road or when carrying heavy payloads, loading as previously described will result in axle assembly10being loaded downward vertically at two locations (on each side of the vehicle) through spring mounts34. The wheel hub24at each outboard end of axle assembly10will apply a resultant wheel load42from each wheel. As these loads are applied at different locations along axle tube12, axle assembly10causes a bending stress, as effectively load42in the upward direction will cause the outboard ends20to be displaced upwards while chassis load40will be applied in the downward direction. Shock from impacts to rough surfaces or potholes can apply a significant amount of bending stress into axle assembly10. This will result in high stresses for the carrier housing16in the area surrounding where tube12is inserted.", "", "Referring toFIG.2, a more detailed view of the tube insertion area of carrier16is shown. The cross-section shown inFIG.2is on the opposite side of the vehicle, with the outboard end (not shown) on the right and the inboard end on the left. The tube12is inserted to the left inFIG.2. For the purposes of this disclosure, overall axle assembly10comprises the following housing arrangement. A central housing50is located between a pair of carrier housings16(one shown inFIG.2). Carrier housings16are fastened to central housing50with a plurality of fasteners52to form a rigid connection. Carrier housing16has a tapering shape with openings on each end. The first inboard end54has a larger opening and is defined by bolt flange56which mates to face58of central housing50. Flange56has a circumferential arrangement of apertures51(FIG.3) for receiving fasteners52. This arrangement provides a stiff and strong connection between carrier housing16and central housing50. At the opposite end of carrier housing16(right side inFIG.2), which receives axle tube12in receiving bore14, a dual ring reinforcement structure70is provided surrounding receiving bore14. The joint between axle tube12and receiving bore14(in particular between axle tube12and the inner ring of the dual ring structure70) is an interference or press fit arrangement.", "", "As carrier housing material16is die cast aluminum and axle tube12is steel, according to one aspect of the disclosure, an interference connection not requiring welding of these dissimilar metals is preferred. Interference fits rely on constant stress and friction within the joint. As axle assembly10will be subjected to large ambient and operating temperature extremes as well as bending loading as previously described, it is desirable that the interface will not change during various operating conditions that could result in a loss of interference fit at the joint. As the thermal coefficients of expansion between aluminum and steel are quite different, a significant interface fit between the receiving bore14of carrier housing16and the outer diameter60of axle tube12is provided. This interference fit prevents and/or limits axle tube12from separating away from or rotating within bore14. To achieve an acceptable interference fit such that the components are tightly connected under all operating conditions, the outer diameter60of axle tube12is larger in diameter than the receiving bore14of carrier housing16. When these components are joined, stresses are introduced into carrier housing14as outer diameter60of axle tube12will exert a force on bore14. These stresses are radial and tangential, with the highest concentration near the inner diameter62of receiving bore14. If a ring structure, immediately radially outward surrounding bore14, is not structurally strong enough to resist the forces from the interference fit, bore14could distort, increasing the diameter of receiving bore14due to the radially outward forces from axle tube12. In traditional carrier housings16made of cast iron, the area around receiving bore14is a simple single ring structure due to the strength of the cast iron material and the ability to plug weld axle tube12to carrier housing16. Analysis was conducted regarding whether such a single ring structure could be utilized with a die cast aluminum carrier housing16, even with increased ring thickness to prevent distortion, and drawbacks were found when compared to the dual ring structure70proposed. Drawbacks to the single ring structure of die cast aluminum included increased weight of a single ring of increased thickness, and utilizing a single ring also increased the variability of interference fit along the length of receiving bore14, resulting in stress concentrations and uneven force distribution within the ring structure from the interference fit forces alone. The benefits of a dual ring structure70of carrier housing16to overcome these drawbacks will be further described.", "", "Continuing to refer toFIG.2Dual ring structure70of carrier housing16surrounds receiving bore14. Dual ring structure70includes an inner ring72and an outer ring74. Both of these rings are continuous in form, fully circumferentially surrounding receiving bore14. Put another way, a cross-section taken perpendicular and transverse to the longitudinal axis at any point along the longitudinal length of the structure70will include a closed loop for each ring. Inner ring72and outer ring74have a variable cross section (parallel to the longitudinal direction as shown inFIG.2) in the area of receiving bore14, increasing in thickness76from outboard face78towards flange56. Inner ring72may have an increased ring thickness76awhen compared to outer ring76bwhen measured at outboard face78. It was found that thickness76bof the outer ring74could be reduced slightly without increasing stress in the dual ring structure70. An array of ribs80are positioned equidistant from each other, in one aspect, to interconnect inner ring72to outer ring74. Ribs80provide a structural connection between the inner and outer rings without requiring a fill of solid material, decreasing cost and mass. Inner ring72and outer ring74continue to taper, increasing in thickness76, finally blending together just inboard of the position where receiving bore14ends, forming a combined ring structure82. The combination of varying the cross-sectional thickness76in both rings along the length of receiving bore14and tying inner ring72and outer ring74together with ribs80results in a more even stress distribution from the forces generated by the interference fit and bending imparted by chassis loading40. Utilizing such a dual ring structure70also reduced deflections of inner diameter62of receiving bore14, particularly towards outboard face78, from the interference press fit forces. Also, the levels of tangential and radial stress distribution are balanced in an improved manner by utilizing the combination of inner ring72, outer ring74and joining ribs80. This lack of deflection, resulting in a consistent and lower stress in the area of the press fit, combined with frictional effects within the joint ensures a proper connection between axle tube12and carrier housing16. To further reduce bending stresses of carrier housing16, an array of triangularly shaped ribs90structurally connect from the radially outer ring74to inboard flange56. Ribs90are planarly and circumferentially aligned with ribs80to improve stiffness and deflections of receiving bore14relative to flange56due to chassis load40and resultant wheel loading42. Utilizing the dual ring structure70and ribs80and90enables the bending loads and stresses to be distributed across the carrier housing16, keeping localized stress levels low enough to allow for the use of lightweight castable materials for the carrier housing16.", "", "Referring now toFIG.3, dual ring structure70can be clearly seen comprising of an inner ring72and an outer ring74with multiple ribs80arranged circumferentially in between. In areas where rib80does not connect rings together, pocket92is formed which extends from outboard face78until where inner ring72and outer ring74converge to form combined ring82(as shown inFIG.2). The planar and circumferential alignment between ribs90and ribs80can also be better seen in this view, where both ribs80and90are formed within the same planes radiating from the central longitudinal axis of the receiving bore14. Apertures or thru holes51to receive fasteners52to connect carrier housing16to central housing50can also be seen.", "", "Now referring and comparing betweenFIG.4toFIG.5, these Figures represent finite element stress analysis (FEA) plots of an axle assembly10with a conventional single ring structure inFIG.4, versus an axle assembly with a dual ring structure70inFIG.5. Both axle assemblies10include a central housing50with a pair of carrier housings16mounted to each side. Analysis used shock loadings representative of 5 times the chassis loading40. Chassis loading40was applied at the location of the spring seat34and a resultant wheel loading42at wheel hub24through bearings26. A pair of axle tubes12inserted into carrier housing16as previously described were considered in the analysis. These forces result in a bending moment on axle assembly10, with a theoretical Von Mises stresses, is calculated and high stress areas are plotted as shown in each figure. Such plots of Von Mises stress can be utilized to determine if a material will yield or fracture. Areas of elevated stresses which would be a concern for die cast aluminum materials are shown by areas defined as \u201cX\u201d in both Figures, with the darkened areas within \u201cX\u201d representing the highest stresses. Note the substantial reduction in higher stressed areas in the dual ring structure70arrangement ofFIG.5versus the single ring arrangement ofFIG.4. The high stress area X is reduced in size in the dual ring embodiment ofFIG.5. Additionally, along the receiving bore14, the overall areas of elevated stress are particularly reduced in size inFIG.5, such that less deflection is occurring within the joint area, which will ensure that the interference fit is maintained. Although some areas of elevated stress are still seen inFIG.5in the area of the receiving bore14, these areas are localized and at a lower absolute level when compared toFIG.4. Also, in the area of rib90, stresses are again significantly reduced, because the dual ring structure70in combination with rib90ensures receiving bore14remains perpendicular to flange56with minimal deflection. The design improvements described above therefore allows for the successful integration and function of joining a steel axle tube14to a die cast aluminum carrier16without the need for additional joining methods (such as welding) or components. It will be appreciated that areas that are not darkened to indicate high stress areas do not all have the same stress level, but rather that these areas are below a level considered to be high stress. An FEA plot includes a gradient of different stress levels and transitions between high stress and low stress. The illustrations ofFIGS.4and5are provided to show the reduced areas of high stress relative to the prior single ring structure, but it will be appreciated that actual stress levels are dependent on actual build and actual loading, and that the stress levels may vary slightly relative to the FEA modeled illustrations.
