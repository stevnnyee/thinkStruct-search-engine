The active position of the auxiliary wheels reduces the deceleration of the central axle108and the shock to the load10, shown schematically inFIG.10, when the caster100encounters uneven terrain. The level arm110rotation creates vertical translation of the auxiliary wheels that allow at least one of the caster multiple wheels to remain in contact with the ground.", "", "The lifting effect/active position also dynamically distributes load10between the primary and auxiliary wheels during use to provide a smooth roll. During normal use of the caster100across a smooth surface, the primary wheel120can support a majority of the load10applied to the caster100. However, when the primary wheel120encounters an obstacle, such as a crack, the leading auxiliary wheel122and/or the trailing auxiliary wheel124can bear the majority of the load10to keep the caster100stable due to the offset as described above. As the leading auxiliary wheel122encounters the crack before the primary wheel(s)120, the level arm110rotates to lower the leading auxiliary wheel122into the crack. Meanwhile, most of the load10is supported by the primary wheel120, which continues to roll along the smooth rolling surface. As the leading auxiliary wheel122exits the crack, and the primary wheel120enters the crack, the level arm110rotates to raise the leading auxiliary wheel122out of the crack and allow it to continue rolling along the smooth rolling surface. Rather than descending into the crack, causing deceleration of the caster100or shock to the load10, the primary wheel120is suspended over the crack by the leading and trailing auxiliary wheels122,124coupled to the level arm110. Because the leading and trailing auxiliary wheels122,124, both engage the smooth rolling surface, substantially the entire load10is supported between the auxiliary wheels, and little to none of the load10is carried by the primary wheel120. As the primary wheel120exits the crack, the trailing auxiliary wheel124can enter the crack, and the level arm110rotates to lower the trailing auxiliary wheel into the crack. Meanwhile, most of the load10is supported by the primary wheel120, which is once again rolling along the smooth rolling surface. Because at least one wheel engages the smooth rolling surface and supports most of the load10at any given time, the caster100experiences less shock as it traverses uneven terrain.", "", "A spatial arrangement between the plurality of wheels allows the caster100to smoothly traverse obstacles and discontinuous surfaces. The spatial arrangement of the wheels enables the lifting effect to occur regardless of the angle at which the caster100encounters an obstacle. In some embodiments, the primary wheels120and auxiliary wheels122,124are spaced apart, both laterally (i.e., with respect to a direction extending along the longitudinal axis1000) and longitudinally (i.e., in a front-to-rear direction). This spatial arrangement of the wheels provides the caster100with a wide base and prevents the wheels within each given wheel set from all impacting an obstacle simultaneously. Therefore, there is always at least one wheel of every given wheel set supporting the load10weight on the main rolling surface at any given time. The spatial relationship between the wheels within a given wheel set can be characterized by an attack angle \u03b1, described in detail below.", "", "The attack angle \u03b1 is a characteristic of the spatial relationship between the primary wheel120and auxiliary wheels of the caster100. As shown inFIG.6, the attack angle \u03b1 can be defined as the included angle between a first reference line A connecting the primary wheel120and the leading auxiliary wheel122of a particular wheel set and a second reference line B extending parallel to the longitudinal axis1000. The first reference line A can connect a first reference point R1located on the leading auxiliary wheel122and a second reference point R2located on the primary wheel120. The first reference point R1is the forwardmost and outermost (i.e., furthest spaced away from the fork102) point of the leading auxiliary wheel122. Similarly, the second reference point R2is the forwardmost and outermost point of the primary wheel120. Different configurations of the leading and primary wheel120can alter the relationship between the first and second reference point R1, R2, thus altering the directionality of the first reference line A.", "", "The attack angle \u03b1 relates the position of the first and second reference points R1, R2. The attack angle \u03b1 is dependent on the size and location of the primary wheel120and the leading auxiliary wheel122. Specifically, different attack angles \u03b1 are formed upon differences in (1) the lateral spacing between the primary wheel120and leading auxiliary wheel122, (2) the front-to-rear spacing between the primary wheel120and leading auxiliary wheel122, (3) the widths of the primary wheel120and leading auxiliary wheel122, and (4) the diameters of the primary wheel120and leading auxiliary wheel122. In this way, the attack angle \u03b1 can be manipulated by changing the spatial relationship between the leading and primary wheels120and/or by altering the diameter and/or width of the leading auxiliary wheel122and primary wheel120. For example, providing a greater lateral distance between the leading auxiliary wheel122and the primary wheel120creates an attack angle \u03b1 that is shallower (i.e., closer to 60 degrees). In contrast, providing a smaller lateral distance between the leading auxiliary wheel122and the primary wheel120creates an attack angle \u03b1 that is steeper (i.e., closer to 30 degrees). Similarly, altering the diameter and/or width of one or more wheels within the wheel set changes the location of the first reference point R1and/or second reference point R2, which in turn alters the orientation of the first reference line A. Embodiments of a plurality of wheels having desired diameters and widths, for the appropriate attack angle \u03b1 are described below.", "", "In some embodiments, the primary wheel120is laterally spaced away from the plurality of auxiliary wheels to create the attack angle \u03b1. In general, the plurality of auxiliary wheels comprise an \u201cinline\u201d configuration, in which the leading and trailing auxiliary wheels122,124are positioned in a straight line from the front of the caster100to the rear. The primary wheel120is not in line with respect to the auxiliary wheels, but rather is laterally offset from the auxiliary wheels. The fork provides the necessary offset of the primary wheel120from the auxiliary wheels. For example, as illustrated byFIG.5, the primary wheel120is laterally spaced further from the fork102than the auxiliary wheels, such that the auxiliary wheels are located between the primary wheel120and the fork102. The primary wheels can be offset by approximately at least one half of the wheel width in the lateral direction. In alternative embodiments, the primary wheel120can be laterally spaced closer to the fork102than the auxiliary wheels, such that the primary wheel120is located between the auxiliary wheels and the fork102. The lateral spacing can be characterized by the distance between a pair of planes between the auxiliary wheels, in particular the leading auxiliary wheel122and the primary wheel120, and with respect to one another.

The attack angle reduces the likelihood that multiple wheels in the set will impact an obstacle at the same time.

Another factor which may influence the lifespan of a tire may be the quality of the driver's education in a respective country. A further factor to consider may be the driving rules in the different countries. While some countries such as the Netherlands have very strict speed limits even on motorways, there are other countries such as Germany which have no speed limit on motorways. This leads to the fact that a tire may undergo completely different stress depending on the country.", "", "Moreover, it has to be taken into consideration that the boundary conditions in various countries may be not very homogeneous.

In many countries, the quality of infrastructure in the large economic centres may be different than in rural areas.

For example, the tire wear may be different if a vehicle is rather used for short distances with lots of stop and go traffic or primarily for long distance travels, where in particular trucks often have a constant speed for long continuous time periods. In addition, one may consider taking into account the actual measured tire pressure as a further factor contributing to tire wear. In case the pressure is for example too low (i.e., deviating from the recommended tire pressure), the contact area between the tire and the road is increased. As a result, the tire wears faster. The information about the actual measured tire pressure is even more important in connection with the tractor load of the vehicle. As it may be known, the recommended tire pressure depends on the load of the vehicle. So, if the load of the vehicle is high, however, the measured tire pressure is in the range of the recommended tire pressure for an unloaded vehicle, the tire wear is still increased.", "", "In general, i.e., without considering the tire pressure, load will have an influence on the tire wear.
