Preferably, the coupling may vary between a diametric clearance of 0.01 mm to an interference of 0.05 mm (in all cases relative to the diameters of the two coupling surfaces). Indeed, greater interference would excessively deform the ring50and, in particular, would increase the external diameter thereof with a consequent impact on the coupling between the cylindrical surface56aof the toothed sleeve55and the cylindrical surface52of the ring50, for which adequate clearance is required, as mentioned above.

Consequently, the disclosed arrangement does not adversely affect the structural strength of the flanged hub20or the available internal radial space. Consequently, the size of the radial ball bearings also remains unchanged.", "", "With reference toFIG.3, the axial stop for the second radial ball bearing60is advantageously formed by a spacer70located radially inside the flanged hub20and axially outside the radial ball bearing60. The spacer70is in turn axially blocked against the second axial shoulder27of the flanged hub20.", "", "More specifically, the two radial bearings59,60and the spacer70can be pressed by a ring (known and not illustrated) against the shoulders26,27, thereby exerting axial compression forces through the outer rings of the bearings59,60and the spacer70onto the flanged hub20that, in response to the stresses transmitted by the wheel, generate reactive forces on the shoulders26,27and in particular on the axially inner second shoulder27, since it is located in the part of the flanged hub20with a radial section SR of reduced thickness. Indeed, this radial section SR coincides with a radially outer relief groove29of the flanged hub20that is required to machine the toothed coupling profile23between the flanged hub20and the toothed sleeve52, and therefore necessarily has a reduced thickness.", "", "The presence of the spacer70helps to improve the performance under stress of the geometry of the flanged hub20. Indeed, to enable grinding operations to be carried out on the radially inner seat28of the flanged hub20, which accommodates the second radial ball bearing60and the spacer70, a relief groove80has to be defined between the seat28and the second axial shoulder27of the flanged hub20. The relief groove80is therefore axially outside the seat28and radially inside the entire flanged hub20. The presence of the spacer70enables the relief groove80to be positioned sufficiently far away from the radial section SR of reduced thickness of the flanged hub20(a more critical section in terms of stress). This enables the relief groove80to be designed with greater freedom, for example with a sufficiently large radius R, but primarily does not concentrate stresses in the vicinity of the narrow section SR of the flanged hub20.", "", "Consequently, the inclusion of the spacer70, which is used as an axial shoulder for the axially inner radial ball bearing60, is primarily intended to enable the provision of a radially inner relief groove80that is different in shape and position compared to the relief groove that would be possible to provide without the spacer70.", "", "This resolves several structural criticalities. Indeed, if there were no spacer, the radially inner relief groove would coincide (be aligned) with the radial ball bearing60and would therefore be in a position axially \u201cfacing\u201d the radially outer relief groove29. Furthermore, if the radially inner relief groove coincides with the radial ball bearing, the shape therefore would be conditioned by the geometry of the radial ball bearing, with very limited axial length and radius (for example, axial length in the order of 2 mm and radius in the order of 0.8 mm). All of this creates a very reduced narrow section SR of the flanged hub, and a notch effect caused by the presence of the radially inner relief groove.", "", "The flanged hub is subjected to high bending loads in this zone, which generate high stresses that have an adverse effect on the service life of the flanged hub itself.", "", "Conversely, the inclusion of the spacer70provides numerous advantages. For one, the radially inner relief groove80is provided in a more axially outer position, which is therefore further away from the radially outer relief groove29and the narrow section SR. In addition, the geometry of the relief valve80is characterized by larger radii and a greater overall length, with a consequent reduction in the notch effect. When required by the application, it is also possible to include an axially inner second radial ball bearing beside the first ball bearing without modifying the flanged hub but by merely reducing the axial dimension of the spacer70. The second radial ball bearing may be useful where one ball bearing is not enough to withstand the stresses coming from the constant velocity joint.", "", "With reference toFIG.4, one key geometric parameter for optimizing the relief groove80and eliminating the structural problems of the flanged hub is the geometry of the groove itself. The radius R of the relief groove80should preferably be between 1.8 mm and 2.2 mm, while the axial length L can preferably vary between 3.8 mm and 4.2 mm. A second geometric parameter is the axial position of the relief groove80. The limit positions, both on the axially inner side and the axially outer side, can advantageously be identified to avoid structural criticalities. In particular, the axially inner limit position of the relief groove80could coincide with the projection on the axis X of rotation of the pressure center C between the rolling bodies33and the raceway34\u2032 of the radially inner ring34, since the forces coming from the external loads are mainly discharged in this zone.", "", "Furthermore, the axially outer limit position of the relief groove80could be defined at a distance D of between 2.4 mm and 2.6 mm in an axially inward direction with respect to the shoulder22of the flanged hub20that forms the stop of the radially inner ring34on the flanged hub20. This prevents the relief groove80from being aligned with the shoulder22and with the adjacent connection22bof the flanged hub20, so as not to generate increased stress at the radius RA of the connection22b, as deduced from the results of the structural analyses carried out.", "", "Consequently, the axial position of the relief groove80is inside the stretch RP defined by the two limit positions mentioned above and indicated by the double arrow inFIG.3.", "", "In short, the adoption of the ring50between the rolled edge24of the flanged hub20and the toothed sleeve55provides the a plurality of advantages. These include the rolled material being deformed and pressed against a continuous surface with no gaps (about the full 360\u00b0 of the circumference). This prevents discontinuities in the material that could cause a concentration of stresses and potential starting points for cracks on the rolled edge24, in particular in the vicinity of the bending point F from which the rolled edge24bends radially outwards. In addition, no deformations are induced on the radially inner ring34that could alter the raceway34\u2032 thereof and/or modify the osculation thereof. Such deformations may also increase the fatigue stresses between the rolling bodies and the raceway and reduce the service life of the hub-bearing assembly. Also, as a result of the clearance fit between the ring50and the toothed sleeve55, no radial expansion is induced in the external toothed profile57of the toothed sleeve55, thereby avoiding any malfunction (failed or difficult coupling) between the toothed sleeve and the ring gear of the disconnection system during operation. Finally, there is a substantial reduction in stresses and consequently deformations of the seat of the axially inner radial ball bearing of the flanged hub.", "", "The use of the spacer70together with the ring50provides further advantages. These include a greater robustness of the flanged hub20in the zone between the shoulder27and the rolled edge24, i.e. in the most structurally stressed zone, improving the capacity thereof to withstand loads. Also, the zone of the relief groove does not require local thermal treatment, which has a positive impact on the process and resulting costs. Furthermore, the solution is flexible in that the length of the spacer can be modified to enable two axially inner radial ball bearings to be inserted without modifying the design of the flanged hub. Indeed, the decision to use one or two axially inner radial ball bearings (naturally in addition to the axially outer radial ball bearing) can be taken at any stage of development without resulting in design modifications to the flanged hub.", "", "In addition to the embodiment of the disclosure as described above, it is to be understood that there are numerous other variants.

The beam212impacts the treaded surface of the tire104, and a portion of the emitted light is reflected back towards the device100, in the form of a reflection216of the beam212. The reflection216returns through the window208and is captured by the image sensor204. The positions of the image sensor204, the emitter200and the window208relative to one another can be stored as calibration data in the device100. The calibration data can be used along with a location at which the reflection216impacts the image sensor204(e.g., pixel coordinates at the image sensor204) to determine a depth D from the image sensor204to the point on the tire104at which the reflection216originated.", "", "To collect depth measurements as the device100traverses the tire104, the sensor204is configured to capture a sequence of representations of the tire104, such as images of the tire104, each depicting or otherwise representing a corresponding reflection216. For example, the representations can include one-dimensional or two-dimensional images with brightness values of one or more pixels indicating the position at which a reflection216impacted the sensor204. In other examples, the representations can include depth measurements, e.g., obtained from an ultrasonic sensor or the like. The position at which the reflection216impacts the sensor204varies with the distance between the sensor204and the treaded surface of the tire104. Turning toFIG.3, a sequence300of images is illustrated, captured as the device100traverses the tire104in the scan direction S. Each individual image304includes a region308corresponding to a reflection216(e.g., distinguished by a higher intensity, different color, or the like, than the remainder of the image304). As the device100traverses the tire104, the positions of successive regions308in successive images304changes with the tread depth of the tire104. The device100can be configured to combine the reflections308from the sequence300of images into a tire profile312. For example, the tire profile312can include an image in which the \u201cX\u201d coordinate corresponds to a distance along the scan direction S, and the \u201cY\u201d coordinate corresponds to a depth. The profile312can be provided to another computing device, displayed by the device100, analyzed to convert the Y positions of the reflections308to tread depth measurements, and the like.", "", "Traversing the tire104with the device100may involve an operator holding the device100over the tire104and swiping the device100across the tire in the scan direction S, while maintaining a substantially constant distance between the device100and the tire104(e.g., while keeping the device100substantially horizontal). Some devices100are configured to capture images such as the sequence300for a predetermined period of time upon initiation of a scan (e.g., four seconds, although a wide variety of other time periods can also be employed).", "", "However, a fixed-length time period may result in termination of the scan before the device100has completely traversed the tire104. For example, an inexperienced operator and/or a large tire, may require more time than permitted by the fixed scan period to traverse the treaded surface with the device100. The resulting tire profile312may therefore be incomplete. In other scenarios, the fixed-length time period may result in inefficient deployment of the device100. For example, an experienced operator and/or a small tire may require less than time than dictated by the fixed scan period to traverse the treaded surface with the device100. The scan may therefore be completed, but the device100may not be ready to initiate a further scan until the fixed scan period has elapsed.

Other images may produce reflections216that reach the sensor204, but correspond to depths greater than the threshold616.
