The main vent aperture and the transverse vent passage are connected to provide a continuous path for fluid communication. The main vent aperture includes a conical surface that is tapered to be narrower nearer the inner side of the vent plug. A poppet is located within the main vent passage and the poppet has a stem that extends from a distal portion of the poppet. The stem has a shoulder that is opposite the distal portion. The distal portion is adjacent to the conical portion of the main vent aperture. The distal portion has an annular recess for receiving a seal. The poppet is movable between an open and closed position.", "detailed_description": ["FIG.1shows a perspective view of a hubcap8into which a plug10is inserted. The hubcap8fits into the hub and seals the chamber holding wheel bearings. The hub and bearings are not shown but the use of a hubcap to seal the open end of a bearing chamber is well known in the trailer industry where the plug10of the present invention is particularly useful. The plug10fits into a hole14in the hubcap8.", "", "The plug10has an inner surface20that faces toward the bearings when it is installed in a hubcap8. The plug10has an apron26that is designed to be on the inside of the hubcap8when the plug10is installed within it. The apron26has a retention groove28that is designed to be an interference fit within the hole14of the hubcap8. The plug10is typically made of an elastomeric material having a relatively stiff durometer (approximately 75) and will resiliently bend to form an airtight and watertight seal with the hubcap8. Because the apron26is larger than the hole14into which the plug10is installed, it will be securely retained in the hubcap8. The apron26surrounds an annular channel32that allows for flexing of the apron26inwardly as it is installed into the hubcap8.", "", "Within the plug10is a valve assembly38.FIG.9shows the valve assembly38that is a separate part from the plug10itself. The valve assembly38may be made of harder materials than the plug10itself and is insertable within the plug10itself. The valve assembly38may be made of metal or plastic. The valve assembly38has a housing42that is a shape of revolution designed to be insertable into the plug10. The housing42has a collar44on its outer diameter48and the outer diameter48on either side of the collar44is generally a cylindrical shape. The housing42has a main vent aperture50that extends through the housing42. The main vent aperture50includes an inner shoulder54near side of the housing42facing the inner surface20of the plug10. Directly adjacent to the inner shoulder54in the main vent aperture50is a pilot diameter56that is a relatively narrow diameter adjacent to the inner shoulder54. The pilot diameter56is a smooth guiding surface that continues into a conical surface60. The conical surface60is narrower near the side of the housing42that faces the inner surface20of the plug10. The conical surface60is widest near the end of the housing42opposite where it faces the inner surface20of the plug10.", "", "A poppet68is held within the main vent aperture50. The poppet68has a pair of shoulders70at one end. The shoulders70of the poppet68are designed to be a clearance fit within the main vent aperture50near the inner surface of the plug10. A stem74extends from the shoulders70of the poppet68in the opposite direction of the inner surface20of the plug10. The stem74is a flat bar that extends away from the shoulders70. The stem74has rounded sides78that act as a guide within the pilot diameter56of the main vent aperture50. The stem74also has flat sides79that are well spaced from the pilot diameter56as shown inFIG.8. A spring80is compressed between the shoulders70of the poppet68and the inner shoulder54of the main vent aperture50. As shown inFIGS.6-9, the spring80is a compression spring that circumscribes the stem74and pushes against the shoulders70of the poppet68and the inner shoulder54of the main vent aperture50. It is contemplated that other types of springs or biasing mechanisms could be used to bias the poppet68in the same manner as spring80. The rounded sides78of the stem74allow the poppet68to slide within the pilot diameter56of the main vent aperture50without cocking in a fashion that would cause the poppet68to jamb at an awkward angle. The clearance between the rounded sides78and the pilot diameter56is small enough that simultaneous engagement of both rounded sides78is possible on opposite sides of the stem74. It should also be noted that the shoulders70are rounded to slidingly engage an inboard diameter75in the main vent aperture50and this also facilitates smooth movement of the poppet68. The shoulders70slide smoothly within the inboard diameter75and this sliding enhances the guided length of the poppet68so that it is less likely to cock within the pilot diameter56. This configuration significantly reduces the chance that the poppet68will bind in the pilot diameter56. The shoulders70are centered with respect to the rounded sides78of the stem74. This allows unobstructed passage of fluid around the stem74through the pilot diameter56because of the relatively distant spacing of the flat sides79and the pilot diameter when compared to the much close spacing of the rounded sides78and the pilot diameter56. As can be seen inFIGS.6and7, the poppet68is movable in an axial direction from a closed position (shown inFIG.7) to an open position (shown inFIG.8). The poppet68has a distal portion88that is opposite to its shoulders70. The distal portion88of the poppet68is different than the stem74in that it is a shape of revolution having a recess90for receiving an O-ring92that acts as a seal. The distal portion88of the poppet68has an outer end surface93. The O-ring92is an elastomeric part that has a larger outer diameter than the pilot diameter56of the main vent aperture50. The recess90is located on the poppet68so that when the spring80is fully compressed, the recess90will be located beyond the outer surface96of the valve assembly38. Compressing the spring80to near its fully compressed height will leave the recess90outside of the housing42so that is accessible for installing the O-ring92into the recess90. Once the O-ring92is snugly held into the recess90by its own elasticity tightening it down within the recess90, the spring80will bias the poppet68into its closed position. The closed position of the poppet68pulls the O-ring92into sealing contact with the conical surface60. Due to the size of the O-ring92, the spring80cannot pull the poppet68back through the pilot diameter56once the O-ring92is installed. The elastomeric nature of the O-ring92will ensure a continuous annular seal around the conical surface60for the entirety of its contact with the conical surface60. The conical surface60serves as a self-centering feature to locate the poppet68at a central location within the main vent aperture50. This self-centering nature of the interface between the O-ring92ensures that when poppet68is moved it begins movement from a position that is centrally aligned within the main vent aperture50. As such, the likelihood that the poppet68will bind or be hindered from movement within the main vent aperture50is minimal.", "", "The valve assembly38is designed to be installed as a unit into the plug10. An inner boss98is spaced from the apron26by the annular channel32so that the annular sidewall100of boss98may flex outwardly to accept the valve assembly38being pushed into the plug10. Once the valve assembly38is installed into the plug10, there is a continuous flow path through the main vent aperture50and into transverse holes104in the plug10itself. The transverse holes104act as transverse vent passages. The transverse holes104intersect with the main vent aperture50to form a continuous flow path through the plug10when the poppet68is in its open position. Because the valve assembly38is tightly held within the plug10and has a collar44the only flow path for any fluid out of the plug10is through the main vent aperture50and the transverse holes104. The spring80is chosen so that a slight pressure rise will allow excess fluid (most likely air) to be expelled through the main vent aperture50and outwardly through the transverse holes104. As fluid is expelled thought the plug10as described, contaminants will not flow backwardly into the plug10and into the main vent aperture50where the contaminants will damage the bearings behind the hubcap8. The transverse holes104prevent direct entry for contaminants, particularly water from pressure washers, because the contaminants would be required to make a ninety degree turn before impinging on the closed poppet68. In other words, the sharp turn lessens the force by which contaminants could enter the main vent aperture50. The seal of the O-ring92is further distanced from the transverse holes104because it is below the outer surface96of the housing42and not in the same plane as the transverse holes104where they connect with the main vent aperture50. The outer end surface93is at or below the outer end surface96of the valve assembly98in the closed position and that allows an unobstructed path for water to travel through oppositely located transverse holes104. This location of the outer end surface93of the poppet68is located to not intersect or obstruct the transverse holes104. In the closed position of the poppet This configuration allows the larger diameter of the distal portion88of the poppet68to shield the O-ring92from damage and contaminants. This shielding will minimize the likelihood that pressure washing the plug10will force contaminants past the O-ring92as it seals on the conical surface60. Operation of the trailer onto which the plug10is installed will generate centrifugal forces that will tend to fling contaminants out of the transverse holes104.", "", "The poppet68of the present invention facilitates a rapid response to any pressure rise within the bearing chamber behind the hubcap8. As can be seen inFIG.8, a predetermined rise in pressure behind the hubcap8, will move the poppet68in an axial direction into its open position as shown inFIG.8. The shape of the stem74facilitates a high flow rate of fluid through the main vent aperture50. Because the stem74is generally rectangular in cross section, with rounded sides78, there is a significant amount of space between the stem74and the pilot diameter56adjacent to the flat sides of the stem74, as shown inFIG.8. This facilitates rapid discharge of fluid past the poppet68, and then a quick return of the poppet68into the closed position because the spring80will bias the poppet68into the closed position once there is no pressure differential. The rapid flow of fluid past the poppet68when it is in its open condition is also enhanced by the fact that the distal portion88is generally conical adjacent to the conical surface60. It is possible in certain circumstances that the bearing chamber behind the hubcap8will have a lower pressure than the ambient air outside of the bearing chamber. This condition is referred to as a negative pressure condition. The negative pressure condition may be caused by the opposite conditions that cause a pressure rise in the bearing chamber. At times, a rapid cooling of the bearing chamber can occur in a marine application. Submerging a hub to which the hubcap8is attached can cause this negative pressure condition. When that negative pressure condition arises, it is usually a transient condition and the plug10can accommodate a negative pressure condition by having the O-ring92deform as the poppet86is pulled slightly inward toward the bearing chamber. In this manner, the poppet68can minimize the negative pressure condition. In this manner of function, the poppet68functions as a bidirectional valve that can stabilize pressure in a negative pressure condition and a positive pressure condition where the pressure in the bearing chamber is higher than outside ambient air."], "claims": ["a main vent aperture extending from an inner side into said plug and connecting to a transverse vent passage intersecting said main vent aperture, said main vent aperture and said transverse vent passage connected to provide a continuous path for fluid communication, said main vent aperture including a conical surface being tapered as to be narrower nearer said inner side of said plug and wider farther from said inner side, said main vent aperture including a shoulder opposite said conical surface; a poppet located within said main vent passage, said poppet having a stem extending from a distal portion of said poppet and said stem having a shoulder opposite said distal portion, said distal portion of said poppet adjacent to said conical surface, said distal portion including an annular recess for receiving a seal, said poppet movable between a closed position, in which said seal contacts said conical surface, and an open position wherein said seal is spaced from said conical surface; a spring located between said shoulder of said main vent aperture and said shoulder of said poppet, said spring biasing said poppet into said closed position.", "2 .
