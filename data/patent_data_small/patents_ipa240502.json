Black liquor is an example of a material that comprises lignin but is substantially free from cellulose and hemicellulose. Black liquor is a major by-product of pulp and paper industry. Paper is manufactured from softwood and hardwood, which contain significant amounts of lignin; and the process of papermaking separates cellulose and hemicellulose from the wood, while the lignin dissolves in the chemicals thereby forming spent liquor. A typical example of lignin containing material is spent liquor from biomass fractionation, such as pulp mill black liquor.", "", "The term \u201cblack liquor\u201d refers to spent liquor of a Kraft pulp process, i.e. a sulphate process. Spent liquor of a sulphite process also comprises lignin, but that liquor is commonly called \u201cbrown liquor\u201d. However, the sulphite process does not dissolve lignin to the same extent as the sulphate process. Lignin can be extracted from the liquor e.g. by precipitation. Hereinabove the term \u201clignin\u201d in the term HTC-lignin refers to lignin that has been extracted from biomass-based material. More preferably, the term \u201clignin\u201d in the term HTC-lignin refers to lignin that has been extracted, e.g. precipitated, from a spent liquor of a Kraft process or a sulphite pulp process. Lignin needs not be pure lignin. However, typically extraction of lignin includes washing steps of precipitated lignin. Lignin in native form has very high molecular weight. The molecular structure of lignin comprises phenylpropane (C9) units, which are connected to each other, typically via carbon-carbon (C\u2014C) and/or ether (C\u2014O\u2014C) linkages.", "", "Lignin in general contains relatively high amounts of functional groups. Lignin contains functional groups, which may participate in chemical reactions and form chemical bonds. Functional groups typically present in lignin comprise, for example, carbonyl groups, aliphatic hydroxyl groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups. Functional groups of lignin are detectable even after a chemical pulping process, in black liquor. The further processing of lignin containing material, particularly of lignin originating from wood, therefore is environmental and cost-effective way of providing lignin derivatives with functional properties. As indicated above, at least some of the functional group of lignin remain in the HTC-lignin.", "", "Concerning the latter (i.e. hydrothermal carbonization), a hydrothermal carbonization treatment (i.e. a HTC treatment) of lignin refers to a thermochemical conversion process of lignin in an aqueous suspension. Hydrothermal carbonization treatment of lignin produces lignin derivatives having high carbon content and functional groups. In particular, the hydrothermal carbonization treatment (i.e. a HTC treatment) of lignin refers to a thermochemical conversion process of the lignin as defined above in an aqueous suspension at elevated pressure and temperature, typically in a reactor suitable for the purpose. In the treatment, a pressure in the reactor may be in the range of 10 to 40 bar, preferably equal to or higher than 15 bar. A temperature in the reactor may be from 150\u00b0 C. to 300\u00b0 C., such as in the range of 150\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C. The temperature equals the temperature of the aqueous lignin suspension inside the reactor during the hydrothermal carbonization treatment (i.e. HTC treatment). The hydrothermal carbonization may further comprise at least partial refining of the carbonized lignin. Typically, the carbonized lignin may be at least partially charred.

Moreover, the curing may be done only partially, whereby the rubber-based material may be only partially cured. However, in an embodiment, the rubber-based material of the article100,200,300,400,900has been cured. Curing may be a vulcanization process, wherein the uncured material is heated in a temperature typically less than 200\u00b0 C., such as in the range of 150 to 200\u00b0 C. During the curing reaction rubber-based components undergo cross-linking reactions. The formed cross-linked structure bonds the tyre components firmly together.

In illustrative examples, various implementations in accordance with the teaching of the present disclosure may be configured with a larger custom battery. Some designs may include a much longer tubular battery that can still fit into the diameter of a valve stem. These longer batteries would need to be accommodated with a sensor body designed to facilitate the electrical connection in a different location. Such a design may redirect airflow in the sensor body. For example, airflow to the tire is achieved from an opening in the bottom of the valve stem. A \u201cbridge\u201d or bar at the base of the sensor body shows where an electrical connection from the battery to the sensor could be made. In practice, it is best to keep high pressure air away from the battery connections or battery electricals, and in view of this a sensor body designed to accommodate a larger battery may be configured to direct air to exit somewhere in the middle of the sensor body or valve stem. The battery size is only restricted by length up to about 4 inches, since this is what could realistically fit inside a wheel/tire assembly. Batteries may be 2-3 inches in length. The diameter of the battery should not exceed the diameter of the valve stem core. This will allow the novel design to be compatible with current standardized sizes.", "", "In illustrative examples, various implementations in accordance with the teaching of the present disclosure may have tubular batteries permanently attached to the valve stem core. This allows technicians to replace the battery in one step when they remove the valve stem core. This also improves safety, as an un-affixed battery will be pushed out by the air in the tire once the valve stem core is removed. The battery and the valve stem core may be configured independently in an exemplary implementation. The technician would unscrew the valve stem core, and the air pressure in the tire would push the battery out. This introduces a possible safety concern, as the unsecured battery could projectile out of the tire if there is sufficient pressure. The battery may be non-permanently affixed to the valve stem core. The valve stem core may affix to the battery via an intermediary \u201cclip\u201d or retainer.", "", "In illustrative examples, various implementations in accordance with the teaching of the present disclosure may have the valve stem adapted to work with various battery designs. For example, the valve stem may need to have a different interior cavity than existing standard valve stems. Once airflow reaches a certain point of the valve stem, any exit point can facilitate air to the tire. An increased valve stem cavity size may facilitate the battery attached to the end of the valve stem. The airflow travels out of the base valve stem, around the battery and electrical connections, through an exit in the sensor body and into the tire. Some implementations may have the electrical connections isolated in the sensor body, and the airflow will exit the valve stem before the sensor body. The airflow to the tire from the valve stem is not the same passageway where the sensor measures air pressure. An exemplary TPMS sensor may feature the pressure sensor mounted somewhere on the sensor body.", "", "In illustrative examples, various implementations in accordance with the teaching of the present disclosure may have electrical contacts configured to connect the battery. For example, the electrical contacts on the sensor side may press down on the battery connection regardless of whether the valve stem core is in the open or closed position. Some electrical connection designs may feature two or more electrical \u201cprongs\u201d that reach out and facilitate both the positive and negative connections. The battery may be grounded to the valve stem. Some batteries may be designed with a long electrical \u201cstem\u201d at the base of the battery to facilitate articulation. Some existing batteries have a \u201cstem\u201d at the base that is long enough to connect electrically, but not long enough to articulate and maintain connection.

More specifically, the invention relates to configuring a TPMS sensor with an externally replaceable battery. The valve stem facilitates the battery replacement with a valve stem core designed to removably secure a battery within the valve stem and a sensor configured with an electrical connection designed to connect the sensor to power from the battery. The valve stem may have an interior cavity configured to retain the valve stem core. The battery may be at least partially retained within the valve stem. The valve stem core may be coupled with a battery retaining clip configured to removably secure a battery within the valve stem.

The integrated battery may be removed and replaced through the valve stem while the TPMS sensor assembly remains mounted to a tire rim on a vehicle without deflating the tire, reducing the user's effort replacing the TPMS sensor batteries.

This facilitation may be a result of a TPMS sensor assembly with a valve stem configured to retain a battery within the valve stem and permit a user to replace their TPMS sensor battery by themselves, without specialized tools or the added expense of a professional mechanic.

The prior market suffered from heavy aftermarket penetration. This is largely due to TPMS being required by law in all new vehicles sold in any major worldwide market. TPMS suppliers and the aftermarket benefited considerably more from TPMS than manufacturers did. The benefits of an externally replaceable battery are not just the convenience and time savings, but the effective erasure of aftermarket penetration long term. Consumers previously chose aftermarket sensors for affordability. With externally replaceable batteries in accordance with the teaching of the present disclosure, the most affordable solution may be to replace the battery instead of opting in to a new (aftermarket) sensor. OEMs will want to implement this technology, and their suppliers will be more than happy to sell it to them. In an illustrative example, suppliers will be able to adapt their proprietary sensor technology to the new externally replaceable battery system. Further efforts to reduce costs can be found in the modular aspect of the inventions. Some embodiments separate the valve stem from the sensor, allowing the valve stem to be mass produced.
