Details concerning the association between the barrel, the rim, and the hub, such as the use of intermediate connection members, including without limitation spokes, are described in more detail hereinbelow. By way of general description, the wheel integration technology described herein simplifies and divides the current manufacturing process. A core base wheel design takes advantage of all aspects of the wheel. The base wheel advances design by moving away from the typical restrictions placed by the end ornamental design. Currently, the typical end design maintains the weight of the vehicle. The base wheel of the present disclosure will sustain the weight of the vehicle while not restricting the end-user's ability to freely change ornamental wheel face designs. The base wheel only utilizes the amount of material required to safely maintain the weight and the exertional forces created by the vehicle. This can be accomplished by minimizing the base wheel design and distributing the material that attaches the hub or center of the wheel to the wheel barrel. The base wheel provides integral support to the ornamental face by using surfaces on the posterior aspect that fit and sustain various portions of the ornamental face design. The base wheel and center hub provide the ability to have unsupported spokes or ornamental faces. This has the ability to drastically reduce overall end weight of the wheel as the unsupported structure only needs to have the desired design as it does not bare the weight of the vehicle. If the distance of the hub or center is moved so that a negative offset is obtained, this would create a more useable surface area on the face of the wheel. This surface area combined with the ability to quickly detach faces or spokes allows the end user to drastically change the overall end design of the ornamental face.", "", "Fabricating multiple attachment points from the center of the wheel distributes the weight carrying capacity of the wheel. The attachment points can have multiple designs and variations such as being slightly angled creating a propeller like spoke to maximize surface area and also hide the rear portion of the base wheel. Varying the amount of material and distribution of the center will also allow for different ornamental designs to be applied to the end product. The integrated wheel attaches to the wheel rotor of the vehicle in conventional methods either by using a multi-lug attachment or a center lug attachment.", "", "The center of the integrated wheel utilizes a unique attachment point. It can be incorporated into the initial manufacturing process of the wheel or united to the base wheel. This center attachment point creates the integral part of the base wheel. The center attachment point allows for a secure method to attach different ornamental surfaces to the base wheel. This is accomplished with a fastener-type screw-on cap and coupling attachment for both safety and ability to quickly release and change the ornamental face plate. In the case of the multi-lug hub, low profile lug nuts are used to attach the base wheel. In this case the ornamental surface can be designed to multiple different specifications.", "", "The different ornamental face plate designs can hide the lugs if desired to thereby create a center lug wheel look. The center lug wheel incorporates the center attachment point either from the hub attachment itself (if the vehicle uses a hub-type conversion to a center lug) or secures to the center lug creating the same ability to secure ornamental face plates. The center cap and attachment component allows space for a locking mechanism to protect the ornamental face plate and wheel from theft. This also adds another layer of safety. The ornamental face plate will have a backing with minor ridges and distal insertion points at the wheel barrel that match the base wheel. The distal ridges or insertion may be used if required to stabilize the ornamental face plate during high revolution or wind interference. This would be implemented primarily for properly securing the distal edges of the face (spokes) especially when using more flexible composite material.", "", "Another aspect of the present disclosure is the ability to change the depth of the ornamental face and ornamental spokes inside the barrel of the wheel. This differs from a typical hub cap or beauty ring in the ability to cross different planes in the wheel barrel space. In addition, none of the prior designs can stay attached when there is distortion of the wheel to which they are attached. The structure of the present disclosure has a fixed attachment to a center attachment point on the base wheel, which means any distortion of the wheel barrel on the base wheel does not affect the attachment of the ornamental face to the base wheel.", "", "Referring next to the drawings,FIG.1is an exploded axonometric view of a wheel assembly20, formed in accordance with the present disclosure, positioned adjacent an existing vehicle bearing hub22that includes a vehicle rotor23.", "", "In this implementation, the wheel assembly20includes a base wheel24formed of a barrel portion26and a centrally located wheel hub28in the interior of the barrel portion26.

This only requires tooling modifications for offset, diameter and rigidity specifications and will decrease manufacturing costs. It also decreases the environmental footprint of the manufacturing process. The base wheel can apply multiple types of manufacturing processes such as forging, casting, multi-piece and flow-forming, amongst others, to achieve desired structural capabilities. Different types of materials can also be used, such as aluminum, magnesium, or composite type carbon fiber to create lightweight forms. Base wheel technology will essentially decrease the overall weight of the base wheel despite material or process used. This, in turn, will decrease unsprung weight in the wheel, enhancing performance/handling and improve fuel economy. If at any point it is desired to run the wheel at its lightest capability, then it only requires the end-user to remove the ornamentation and center attachment cap. The base wheel essentially uses the least amount of material to bear the weight of the vehicle; hence it is the lightest that can be produced safely. The base wheel allows for a cosmetically appealing, lightweight final product that still adheres to current designs while having the ability to add decorative features as desired. The base wheel is set apart by perpetuating these desirable design features, like the spacing of the base wheel attachment points (spokes) to visualize the caliper and rotor of a vehicle. This allows for desired visualization of these components and cooling of the braking system in the performance realm as well as aesthetics in the customization world.", "", "The center attachment point on the wheel pushes the capability of customization to new levels.

Changing from a concave (negative) look offset to a more neutral or positive look is facilitated with the present disclosure. The locking mechanism can be removed and the cap untightened, to swap the ornamental face plate. Having the capability of changing the look of a wheel is a welcomed and overdue innovation in the automotive wheel realm. This integrated wheel technology drives the cost of creating easily interchangeable wheel faces down. This cuts down on waste and amount of product needed to create a whole new wheel. This also leads to the use of different types of materials to comprise the face of the wheel, such as composites or metals that usually require large amounts of machining to attain different finishes and colors.", "", "Wheel integration technology has the potential to innovate multiple aspects of the automotive wheel market. The base wheel allows for the ability to easily swap and change faces, colors, and multiple designs can be placed on the base wheel. This is attained without having any load bearing surfaces. Customization can also be applied to the center lug/cap, incorporating different designs and colors.
