A portion of the first stretchable material moves in the direction radial to the axle, to control adhesion of a portion of the outer circumferential surface to the surface of the structure. A method implements use of the wheel to adhere to the surface of the structure.", "detailed_description": ["Example embodiments consistent with the teachings included in the present disclosure are directed to wheels with controllable suction devices for adhesion on surfaces.", "", "In a first embodiment shown inFIGS.1-4, a wheel10has an outer ring12with a plurality of apertures14in which are disposed a stretchable material16. The stretchable material16can be composed of natural rubber. Alternatively, the stretchable material16can be composed of synthetic rubber. In a further alternative embodiment, the stretchable material16can be composed of any known resilient material which can deform in response to suction of gases such as air, or liquids. Such a resilient material can return to a non-deformed state in response to removal of the suction effect of the gases. Accordingly, in response to control of the suction of the gases, the stretchable material16acts as a suction cup to create a vacuum between the suction cup and a surface18. Thus, the deformed stretchable material16can have an adhesion effect between the wheel10and a portion of a surface18adjacent to the deformed stretchable material16. The surface18can be a non-metallic surface of a structure, and so the wheel10does not require magnetic attraction to adhere to the surface18. Alternatively, the surface18can be a metallic surface.", "", "Referring toFIGS.1-2, the outer ring12has brackets20,22extending from a central region24having an axle26and a motor driving gear28. An inner ring30has an inner gear32on a sleeve bearing34, to which is connected at one end36of a linear actuator38. The linear actuator38can be a telescoping pair of rods40,42. The inner gear32engages the motor driving gear28to rotate the inner ring30on roller bearings44within the inner periphery of the outer ring12. The inner ring30has a diaphragm46coupled to the other end48of the linear actuator38. A pair of diaphragm holding bars50,52are disposed on either side of a portion54of the diaphragm46. When the telescoping pair of rods40,42of the linear actuator38operate to have the lower rod42extend into the upper rod40, the linear actuator38pulls and lifts the portion54of the diaphragm46away from the stretchable material56,58below the portion54. The portion54then balloons and lifts the stretchable material56,58upwards by a vacuum effect. Therefore, in conjunction with the linear action of the rod42of the linear actuator38and the lifted stretchable material56,58, a suction effect occurs at the location of the outer ring12adjacent to the surface18below the location of the lifted stretchable material56,58. Accordingly, the wheel10adheres to the surface18of a structure.", "", "In order to adhere the wheel10to the surface18, the linear actuator38is controlled by code stored in a memory and executing in a hardware processor to move the rod42away from the surface18, and so to lift and balloon the portion54of the diaphragm46. Alternatively, the linear actuator38is electrically operated, and is independent of the motor driving gear28. The motor driving gear28operates to keep the wheel inner ring30and the linear actuator38, which is mounted rigidly on the inner ring30, perpendicular to the surface18in order to create the adhesion. The center motor driving gear28and the linear actuator38are parts of the inner ring30and coupled together.", "", "In a further alternative embodiment, the actuator38is controlled to extend or retract the rod42by a gear assembly connected to the motor driving gear28such that rotation of the wheel10causes the rod42to move towards the longitudinal axis, causing the adhesion of the wheel10to the surface18, and ceasing of the rotation of the wheel10causes the rod42to move away from the longitudinal axis, which reduces or eliminates the adhesion of the wheel10to the surface18.", "", "When the portion54of the diaphragm46is lifted, a vacuum is created between the portion54and the stretchable material56,58. The stretchable material56,58deforms to create the suction effect and adhesion of the wheel10to the surface18. To release the wheel10from the surface18, such as when a crawler having the wheel10disengages from the surface18, the code executing in the hardware processor moves the rod42towards the surface18. Such movement of the rod42removes the biasing force of the rod42from the portion54of the diaphragm46, which restores the diaphragm46to the unstretched configuration. In turn, the vacuum between the portion54of the diaphragm46and the stretchable materials56,58is reduced or ceases, which restores the stretchable materials56,58to the undeformed state. Therefore, the suction effect is reduced or eliminated, and so the adhesion between the wheel10and the surface18is reduced or eliminated, allowing the wheel10to disengage from the surface18.", "", "It is to be understood that the suction effect is not limited to providing adhesion between the wheel12and a non-metallic surface18. In addition, the suction effect can provide adhesion between the wheel12and a metallic surface, or between the wheel12and a hybrid surface composed of portions of both non-metallic material and metallic material.", "", "During rotation of the wheel10, including the outer ring12, adjacent to the surface18, the linear actuator38can stay substantially perpendicular to the portion of the surface18being traversed. As the wheel10rotates, the suction effect of the stretchable material56,58reduces or ceases with contacting portion of the surface18as the stretchable material56,58moves away from the contacting portion of the surface18. However, since the linear actuator38remains substantially perpendicular to the portion of the surface18being traversed, additional stretchable material60,62arrives under the ballooned portion54of the diaphragm46, so that such stretchable material60,62generates a suction effect with the portion of the surface18being traversed. Accordingly, during actuation of the linear actuator38, the portion54of the diaphragm maintains a continuous suction effect between the surface18and the wheel10, and so the wheel10adheres to the surface18in any orientation.", "", "In an alternative embodiment shown inFIG.5, a wheel70has a compressor or pump72connected by a tubular line74to a tube76connected at one end78to the portion54of the diaphragm46. The pump72can be a pneumatic pump. The pump72moves gases, such as air, or liquids into or out of the tubular line74and the tube76. By controlling the flow of gases or liquids, the pump72can maintain a negative pressure on the portion54of the diaphragm46to balloon the portion54. In addition, by controlling the flow of gases or liquids, the pump72can maintain zero or positive pressure on the portion54to restore the portion54of the diaphragm46to the unstretched state.", "", "In order to adhere the wheel70to the surface18, the pump72is controlled by code stored in a memory and executing in a hardware processor to establish a negative pressure or a vacuum on the portion54of the diaphragm46, and so to lift and balloon the portion54of the diaphragm46. Alternatively, the tube76can be replaced by a linear actuator. The pump72can be utilized to operate the linear actuator movement. The pump72is directly withdrawing or supplies air, another gas, or a liquid to the inside of the linear actuator to provide linear movement which causes suction to the balloon diaphragm46and cause adhesion. The pump72is not mechanically coupled to the motor driving gear28.", "", "In a further alternative embodiment, the pump72is controlled to be turned on or off by a gear assembly connected to the motor driving gear28such that rotation of the wheel10causes the pump72to establish the negative pressure, and so increasing the adhesion of the wheel10to the surface18.

A stretchable material88is disposed in the apertures86which act as suction cups, as described in greater detail below. An inner sleeve90is coupled to the outer ring82by the brackets92,94from which an axle96extends. A plurality of springs98,100,102bias a plurality of bars104,106,108, respectively, inward towards the longitudinal axis of the wheel80coincident with the axle96. As shown inFIG.6, the springs98,100,102are elongated and in a state of tension due to interaction between a respective bar104,106,108and wedges and latching mechanisms as shown inFIG.7-12, as described in greater detail below. However, the spring114inFIG.6is in its non-tension state with a stretchable material116pulled to create a suction effect on the surface18adjacent to the wheel80at the location of the stretchable material116. Accordingly, the wheel80has adhesion to the surface18at the location of the stretchable material116.", "", "As shown inFIG.6, an activator switch118extends through a slot120in the outer circumferential surface84.

Referring toFIG.7, the activator switch118extends out of the slot120. The activator switch118has a pair of arms122,124extending from a pivot126. An end of the arm122extends out of the slot120and engages the surface18as the wheel80rotates. An end of the arm124engages a latch member128. When the surface pushes the end of the arm122into the slot120, the activator switch118rotates about the pivot126, and moves the end of the arm124away from the latch member128, as shown inFIG.8.", "", "With the arm124pivoted away from the latch member128, the spring102returns to the non-tensioned state by the restorative force of the spring102, as shown inFIG.9. Such a restorative force causes the spring102to pull the bar108and the associated stretchable material116inward towards the longitudinal axis. The pulled stretchable material116creates a suction effect on the location of the surface18adjacent to the stretchable material116. Thus, the pulled stretchable material116acts as a suction cup configured to create adhesion between the wheel80and the adjacent location on the surface18.", "", "As shown inFIGS.10-11, the wheel80also includes a pair of stationary wedges130,132on either side of the bar108which is adjacent to the surface18.

Notably, the difference in E* between the Comparative Example and the Inventive Example is even higher at low temperatures than at high temperatures so that the Inventive Example provides much better grip at low rubber composition temperatures than the Comparative Example. Moreover, it is remarkable that the difference between the E* values at 30\u00b0 C. and the E* values at 70\u00b0 C. is much lower for the Inventive Example than for the Comparative Example. For instance, the difference in E* between 30\u00b0 C. and 70\u00b0 C. of the Comparative Example is 6 MPa, whereas the corresponding value is only 4.7 MPa for the Inventive Example for the same temperatures.

In addition, the Van der Waals attraction is non-destructive in that the attraction does not disrupt or rely on ionic or chemical bonds with atoms or molecules of the non-metallic surface during adhesion.
