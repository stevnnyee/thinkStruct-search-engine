With reference toFIG.5, this figure shows one embodiment of the forecasting method of the invention200, in which embodiment the forecasting model may predict a number of residual landings of the identified tyre with a view to determining its remaining lifetime. The remaining lifetime of the identified tyre comprises a number of landings (or landings per tread or LPT) of the identified aeroplane corresponding to a forecast wear state of the identified tyre. In this embodiment, the method therefore concerns construction of a model for forecasting the number of residual landings of the identified tyre with a view to determining a maintenance schedule. The maintenance schedule of the identified tyre comprises a choice between a service plan (in which the identified tyre remains installed on the identified aircraft) and an inspection plan (in which the identified tyre is inspected with a view to ensuring that it is removed at the right time, either for carrying out retreading thereof or for introducing it into the end-of-life circuit, the latter comprising recycling).", "", "On starting the forecasting method200shown inFIG.5, the forecasting model is constructed on the basis of one or more parameters influencing the wear of the identified tyre.

The database may comprise an already created reference (for example, a table of remaining lifetimes of the aeroplane tyres at a plurality of wear thresholds). The database may include parameters corresponding to a plurality of commercially available tyres (including parameters that form part of the general information discussed above). The specific source of the wear states of a plurality of wear levels is not essential to the method described here, which would function equally well using data obtained exclusively from tyres having reached their wear threshold. By way of example, a system may implement the method of the invention using data obtained from measurements performed on tyres received by a factory after deinstallation of the installed assembly.", "", "This system implements the method of the invention to assist an airline with transmission of information on the progress of wear of the tread of an identified tyre to personnel of an airport served by the airline, perhaps during an inspection of the aeroplane.

The created database may include images of wear profiles corresponding to known wear states and the corresponding number of landings carried out. The wear profile of an identified tyre is defined by the outline of the external surface of its tread during use. Thus, a new tread having not yet been employed is considered to be an envelope worn to 0%, and a tread that meets the manufacturer's advisory conditions for removal is considered to be an envelope worn to 100%. The profile described here may consist of one or more (3D) surface measurements (carried out beforehand) that reproduce all or some of the external surface of a tread. Furthermore, the profile described here may consist of one or more (2D) linear measurements (carried out beforehand) in one or more planes that contain the axis of symmetry of the tread.

As used here, the \u201cremoval threshold\u201d of an identified tyre refers to a regulatory minimum depth (or another threshold defined by the user) at which it must be replaced. During this step, a machine-learning method receives as input the obtained influencing parameters (being the historic information and the general information of the identified tyre) and the data of the created training database.

The GBR learning method aims to predict the number of residual landings (remaining LPT) corresponding to achievement of the removal threshold of the identified tyre. Thus, the output to be predicted of the forecasting model will be the forecast of the wear state of the identified tyre (characterized, for example, by a date range in which the removal threshold of the identified tyre will be reached). This for example allows tyres with an excessively pronounced wear state (i.e. a wear state beyond a predetermined wear threshold that ensures correct operation of the tyre) to be removed preventively. By way of example, in certain use cases, the rate of wear of the shoulder of the identified tyre induces appearance of working plies before the skid limit is reached.

It will be noted that the future-landing data may be hypothetical or real depending on the type of management applied by an airline to its fleet of aeroplanes and its ability to determine, within a given timeframe, the routes to which an aeroplane will be assigned. An offset between the true wear states and the number of forecast landings is denoted by a computed error, such an error indicating a variation in the tread of the identified tyre. The computed errors may be input into the training database (described above) to improve the predictive capacity of the forecasting model.", "", "The forecasting method200further comprises a comparing step208during which the remaining LPT before achievement of the removal threshold of the identified tyre, which is output by the forecasting model, is compared to a value of the removal threshold.

In the case where the tread of the identified tyre has reached or is close to reaching the wear removal threshold, the system100takes into account the wear states of worn tyres obtained from measurements of wear states performed on aeroplane tyres received by a factory after use. In the case where the identified tyre must be replaced by another tyre of the same type, the forecasting model is updated during the replacement of the worn tyre by an identified tyre having a tread considered new (see the number214ofFIG.5).
