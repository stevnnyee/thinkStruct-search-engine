Furthermore, during the press-bonding process of the mold8, the above supporting force also reliably prevents deformation of the spoke portion2(particularly in the form of a shell member) under the above pressing force, thereby avoiding generation of gaps between the composite material7and the mold8or uneven force caused by the deformation. Thus, the overall press-bonding quality is enhanced.", "", "In step S3, as shown inFIG.8, the mold8is used to press-bond the composite material7to the wheel plate assembly1. During the press-bonding process, the gas input portion80is connected to the gas inlet51, and the gas is inputted via the gas input portion80into the gas inlet51to expand the air bag6. Expansion of the air bag6generates an outward pushing force from the interior of the spoke portion2(pressing against the spoke portion2to generate the corresponding supporting force), thereby stably press-bonding the composite material7to the wheel plate assembly1. Particularly, the upper mold81and the lower mold82firstly press-bond the wheel plate assembly1to a preset pressure, and then the gas is inputted via the gas input portion80into the gas inlet51to expand the air bag6to a second preset pressure. Preferably, the temperature of the mold8is increased during the press-bonding process, such that the composite material7is heated and, thus, can be more securely bonded to the wheel plate assembly1.

Therefore, in a case of raising to a specific temperature during the press-bonding process to benefit the press-bonding of the composite material7, the mold8may maintain the desired relatively high temperature required for press-bonding, such that it is not necessary to repeatedly increase the temperature of the mold8(for press-bonding the composite material to the mold onto the wheel plate assembly) and lowering the temperature of the mold8(for adhering the composite material onto the mold).

A drive socket protector for lug nuts and wheels is used to prevent damage at the wheel and lug nut during installation and/or removal of the lug nut by providing a barrier or cover for the tool acting on the lug nut. While this application may frequently reference the example of a lug nut being attached at a wheel of a vehicle, it should be understood that the present disclosure relates to bolts and other attaching hardware as well as other applications in which it is desirable to prevent direct contact between a tool and the fastener on which it is acting and structure surrounding the fastener.", "", "Wheels commonly used by the vehicles listed above typically comprise a center portion or disk configured to engage the wheel hub, an outer rim or barrel configured to retain a rubber tire, and a wheel body or spoke assembly radiating outward from the center portion to the barrel. The wheel hub enables rotation of the wheel about the axle, drive shaft, or the like and provides a number of bolts protruding from the wheel hub in a circular array at which the center portion of the wheel is received. The wheel provides a corresponding circular array of holes at the center portion for receiving the bolts from the wheel hub (at a bolt hole portion) and receiving lug nuts engaged to the ends of the bolts (at a lug hole portion). The holes may be formed through a thickness of the wheel at the center portion, such as at equal spacing about the disk shaped portion of the center portion.", "", "When installed on a vehicle, an inward facing portion of the center portion or disk sits flush against the wheel hub so that the bolts extending from the wheel hub pass through the holes of the wheel and are exposed at an outward facing side of the wheel, generally at the center portion or disk. Lug nuts, having a thread configured to receive the bolts, are then installed at each of the bolts and tightened to retain the wheel at the wheel hub. The lug nuts have a body with a greater diameter than an inner portion (e.g., the bolt hole portion) of the corresponding hole, such as a collar that forms a seat for the lug nut. As the lug nuts engage the bolt, they will engage the wheel and apply a clamping force at the wheel and maintaining the wheel at the wheel hub. Specifically, the lug nuts engage around the inner portion or seat of the hole, such as at an outward facing surface of the center disk surrounding the bolt hole portion.", "", "In each hole, the bolt hole portion (also referred to as the bolt hole) is disposed at an inner portion of the wheel and corresponds to lug hole portion (also referred to as the lug hole) on an outward facing side of the center portion or disk. The holes may be bored from an outward facing side of the wheel, but the largest diameter (i.e., the lug hole portion) does not pass through the entire thickness of the wheel. Rather, the lug hole portion frequently represent bores through an irregular or outer surface of the wheel to present a regular or uniform or matching surface at which the lug nut interfaces with the wheel. The lug hole portion may comprise a number of different configurations, but generally present a uniform seat upon which the lug nut sits. For example, a lug hole portion may present a rounded seat configured to engage a ball-seat lug nut, a tapered seat configured to engage an acorn-seat lug nut, or flat seat configured to engage a flat-seat lug nut. Providing a uniform contact surface at each lug nut is desirable for achieving a uniform torque or clamping force across the many lug nuts, thereby preventing a wobble or uneven rotation of the wheel. At high revolutions, over time, a wobble or uneven rotation of the wheel can lead to uneven wear of the tires, tie rods, and brakes, warping of the wheel hub, broken lug nuts, or other undesirable results.", "", "Sometimes during installation, the lug nut or wheel may be scratched or scuffed or chipped or otherwise marred by the traditional tools used in removing and installing lug nuts (such as lug wrenches, socket wrenches, and impact wrenches). The surfaces of wheels and lug nuts often have an ornamental finish or coating applied to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the vehicle. For example, a surface may be powder-coated, paint-coated, chrome-plated, or polished. These surfaces, however, may be susceptible to scratching or chipping when the hard surface of a lug-attaching tool comes into contact. This damage most commonly occurs in four regions: the lug hole seat, the lug hole wall, the top surface of the lug nut, and the side surfaces of the lug nut. While scratches and like damage primarily affect the aesthetic qualities of the wheel and lug nut, some more severe damages such as chipping may affect a lug nuts ability to provide a consistent clamping force at the wheel. Additionally, because both aesthetic and structural damages to the wheel and lug nuts are undesirable and may cause safety concerns in their own right, they may also lead to a vehicle owner installing replacement wheels or lug nuts not originally intended for the vehicle, providing additional potential for a decline in safety, durability of related parts, or even monetary value of the vehicle attributed to having factory installed parts original to the vehicle. Thus, while lug nuts and wheels may be replaced, it remains highly desirable to maintain lug nuts and wheels in an unblemished state for at least the reasons discussed above.", "", "Referring now to the drawings and the illustrative examples depicted therein, a drive socket protector for lug nuts and wheels is provided.
