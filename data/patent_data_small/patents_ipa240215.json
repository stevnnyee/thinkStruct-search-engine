For example, the material of the connecting element120may include epoxy, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyaryletherketone (PAEK), polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In this embodiment, the two connecting elements120each may further extend to wrap a part of the middle segment111, so that the two connecting elements120can be more firmly fixed to the axle body110, thereby further improving the structural strength of the spoke100against the axial-direction (substantially parallel to direction Z inFIG.4) tensile force.", "", "Please continue to refer toFIG.4. In this embodiment, the connecting element120may be fixed to a wheel of a bicycle (not shown) via a nipple N. The connecting structure121of the connecting element120may be thread, and the nipple N may have an inner thread corresponding to the connecting structure121. In other embodiments, it can be understood that the connecting element120may be fixed to the wheel via a hub, and the connecting structure121is not limited to be thread. In this embodiment, an axis122of each of the two connecting elements120is located on an imaginary plane. Specifically, the axis122substantially extends, for example, along the direction Z, and the imaginary plane substantially extend along the Y-Z plane. The connecting structure121is constructed by a plurality of sawtooth threads1210when viewing at the imaginary plane (i.e., viewing in a direction substantially parallel to the direction X). Please refer toFIGS.4and5together. The sawtooth threads1210each have a tooth tip T. The sawtooth thread1210is divided into a first angle A1and a second angle A2by a connecting line L passing through a central point C of the respective tooth tip T and perpendicular to the axis122. The first angle A1is close to the middle segment111, and the second angle A2is away from the middle segment111, wherein the first angle A1is less than the second angle A2. Therefore, each sawtooth thread1210can have larger tooth thickness so as to further improve the structural strength against the axial-direction tensile force. In addition, the shape of each sawtooth thread1210is asymmetrical to the connecting line L; thus, when the spoke100is subjected to an axial-direction tensile force, parts of the sawtooth thread1210located on both sides of the connecting line L bear inconsistent forces, which can also prevent the sawtooth thread1210from loosing from the nipple N due to excessive local force. In an embodiment, the first angle A1may be between 2-10 degrees, such as about 5 degrees; the second angle A2may be between 40-50 degrees, such as about 45 degrees; but the specific data of degrees is not limited thereto.", "", "Please refer toFIGS.2and3again. In this embodiment, the middle segment111and the two connecting segments112of the axle body110can be integrally formed to further improve the structural strength of the axle body110against the axial-direction tensile force. Moreover, the axle body110may be made by the injection molding process, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In addition, a material of the axle body110includes, for example, fiber composite or thermoplastic in this embodiment. For example, the aforementioned fiber composite may include fiberglass or carbon fiber, the aforementioned thermoplastic may include epoxy, PEEK, PAEK, PEKK etc., and the material of the axle body110is not limited by the present disclosure.", "", "Please refer toFIGS.2,3and4together. The friction enhancing structure1120may be protruded or be recessed from an outer peripheral surface of the middle segment111to enhance the friction between the connecting element120and the connecting segments112of the axle body110, thereby improving the structural strength of the spoke100against the axial-direction tensile force. For example, each of the friction enhancing structures1120includes, for example, a plurality of concave portions R1in this embodiment. The concave portions R1are disposed at intervals along the axial direction of the axle body110, and a convex portion R2is formed between each two adjacent concave portions R1. Specifically, each concave portion R1is, for example, recessed from the first peripheral surface OS1, and the concave portions R1are disposed at intervals on the first peripheral surface OS1so as to form a convex portion R2between each two adjacent concave portions R1. Further, please continue to refer toFIG.4. When the connecting element120is slid relative to the axle body110due to that the connecting element120is pulled by an excessive force along the axial direction, the connecting element120can be pushed by the convex portions R2along a radial direction (substantially parallel to, for example, a direction Y) of the axle body110, and therefore the connecting element120pushes the nipple N along the radial direction. Then, the nipple N can apply a reaction force to the connecting element120since the nipple N is pushed by the connecting element120. As a result, the connecting element120can clamp the connecting segment112of the axle body110again to prevent the connecting element120from continuously sliding relative to the axle body110. In addition, when the convex portions R2push the connecting element120along the radial direction of the axle body110, the connecting structure121of the connecting element120can be more closely abut to inner threads of the nipple N, so as to further prevent the connecting element120from loosing from the nipple N. Please refer toFIGS.2,3and4together again. The convex portions R2and the concave portions R1make the first peripheral surface OS1have a wavy surface in this embodiment. For example, the concave portions R1can make the first peripheral surface OS1have a plurality of concave curve surfaces at intervals, and the convex portion R2forms a convex curve surface between each two adjacent concave curve surfaces. The concave curve surfaces and the convex curve surfaces staggered from each other together make a part of the first peripheral surface OS1have a wavy surface. It can be understood that the specific shape of the friction enhancing structure1120is not limited toFIGS.2to4. For example, the shape of the friction enhancing structure1120may include particles in an embodiment, and the specific shape of the friction enhancing structure1120is not limited in the present disclosure. Incidentally, the axle body110of this embodiment can have two opposite end surfaces113, and the friction enhancing structure1120is located between the respective end surface113and the middle segment111. The connecting element120further extends to wrap the respective end surface113, so that the connecting element120can be more firmly fixed to the axle body110.", "", "In summary, in the spoke of the present disclosure, the connecting element wraps and is fixed to the axle body by means of injection molding, and the area of the axle body wrapped by the connecting element is disposed with the friction enhancing structure to enhance the friction between the connecting element and the axle body. Thus, based on the aforementioned structure, the connecting element can firmly wrap and be fixed to the axle body. Therefore, when the spoke is subjected to an axial-direction tensile force, the connecting element is not easily separated from the axle body, thereby improving the structural strength of the spoke against the axial-direction tensile force.", "", "While the invention has been described in terms of what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention needs not be limited to the disclosed embodiment.

The hub30would be attached by bearing to an axle (not shown). The hub30is connected to the wheel rim1via a web40. Rotor disc drive lugs (or torque bars)50extend axially across the tube well1for engagement with the brake discs.", "", "To protect the wheel rim1from the heat generated during hard braking or from brake disc material ejected during braking, a heat shield is mounted to the inner diameter surface20of the wheel. The heat shield may be a single tubular shield or, as shown in this example, may be formed of several heat shield panels60provided between the rotor drive lugs50. The heat shield/panels60is in the form of several thin metal sheets or layers sandwiched together, including an inner layer601and an outer layer602, and possible one or more intermediate layers603, and with insulation gaps G therebetween, as seen inFIG.4, and is attached to the wheel so as to be spaced apart from the wheel inner diameter surface20by a small insulation gap (not shown). Here, the term \u2018inner layer\u2019 is used for the layer of the heat shield panel closest to the tube well and \u2018outer layer\u2019 is the layer of the heat shield panel furthest from the tube well. Where the heat shield is made of a number of panels or segments attached together, the adjoining edges60a,60bof the panels are connected by means of connectors70. The connectors70each define a seam between adjacent panels.", "", "A typical connector70is shown inFIG.3. Such a connector70is formed to attach to adjacent edges60a,60bof adjacent panels to, in use, define the seam between two adjacent heat shield panels. In the example shown, the connector70comprises two interlocking hook parts70a,70bwhich are affixed, at one end701, to the edge of a respective heat shield panel and form a hook shape702at the opposite end. To connect the two adjacent panels, the respective hook shapes interlock. The end of the connector parts may be affixed to the respective edge of the in various ways provided a secure attachment to the panel is provided. In the example shown, the connector part is affixed to the panel edge by seam welding, but it may be envisaged that other forms of adhesion or fixation, e.g. using fixation elements, may be used. Instead of the hook shapes, other interlocking shapes or features may be used, provided the connector secures the two adjacent panels, at the seam, to each other. The example inFIG.3shows two connectors70provided between a pair of adjacent panels60, but it is also possible for there to be only a single connector or more than two connectors. As mentioned above, each panel60is formed of multiple layers601,602,603(best seen inFIG.4) and these layers will be secured to each other at the edge of the panel to ensure the entire panel is secured by the connector(s). This means that the connector(s) will be affixed to all of the layers (three layers are shown in the examples, but other numbers of layers are possible) and so the layers of a panel60will not be able to move or shift relative to each other.", "", "As mentioned above, in the harsh braking conditions experienced by e.g. wheels on an aircraft landing gear, high temperatures are reached and pieces of hot material can break off from the rotor discs. Thus, in use, the wheel assembly becomes hot and the purpose of the heat shield is to manage the heat generated in the wheel assembly. Accordingly, the heat shield materials also experience high temperatures. The temperature at the inner surface of the heat shield is higher than that at the outer surface which means that the inner layer601of the panels will become hotter than the outer layer602. Consequently, the inner layer will undergo greater thermal expansion than the outer layer. Because, as mentioned above, these layers are fixed relative to each other at the seams, the greater deformation of the inner layer relative to the outer layer causes the heat shield panel60to deform as can be seen inFIG.5where the inner layer601becomes arched or buckles. This can cause the heat shield to be damaged and/or to contact the wall of the tube well1by being deflected into the insulation gap between the heat shield and the tube well interior surface. Because the retainer is made of relatively thin, light material, deformation of the panels can cause the retainer to deflect outwards and contact the wheel rim and this can result in damage and wheel abrasion. Also, if the retainers are not sufficiently strong to retain the heat shield panels in such conditions, the heat shield panels themselves can also contact the wheel. This can cause wheel abrasion and/or heat shield damage/abrasion and require the entire wheel assembly to be replaced.", "", "The aim of the present disclosure is to provide a heat shield panel design having multiple layers, which allows for the different thermal expansion of the layers, whilst they are still connected at their edges, without resulting in deformation of the panel/inner layer.", "", "This is achieved by forming the inner layer601of the heat shield panel as a segmented layer, as seen inFIG.7\u2014i.e. being formed of two or more layer segments601a,601bwith a separation or break601ctherebetween, such that the layer segments are able to move relative to each other in the area of the separation although they are still connected at the panel edges to the outer layer(s).", "", "An example of a heat shield panel with such a segmented inner layer can be seen inFIG.7.", "", "As can be seen, the inner layer601is formed as two layer segments that are separated at their inner edges611a,611b. In the example shown, the inner edges are at the ends of respective inner portions which, in the default state of the heat shield, overlap. The outer edges621a,621bof the layer segments substantially align with the outer edges of the other layer(s)602,603of the panel to define the edges60a,60b, shown inFIG.6, of the panel. By forming the inner layer of two or more layer segments, each layer segment can expand, due to the effects of heat, separately (in the example shown, increasing or reducing the degree of overlap at the inner ends611a,611b) thus reducing the deformation of the inner layer. The result can be seen inFIG.8where the panel stays relatively flat even when subjected to high temperatures.", "", "The panel can be formed with the inner layer segments having their inner edges free and not connected, and the tension under which the heat shield is mounted in the wheel assembly has been found to be sufficient to keep the inner layer such that its inner edges overlap without the need for any physical retaining means. In other examples, though, it may be desirable to provide some form of attachment or barrier at the inner edges which still allows relative movement of the edges and, thus, the segments, but present a barrier to any dust e.g. carbon dust from the brake components, or other contamination, passing through the break. Carbon dust can, for example, increase the heat conductivity of the heat shields which can then result in even higher temperatures at the wheel. Some examples of such attachment are shown inFIGS.9A and9B. In the example inFIG.9A, an additional plate620may be attached e.g. by a spot weld630to one of the segments and extend across the other segment to press the segments, at their inner edges, closer together whilst still allowing them to slide relative to each other.
