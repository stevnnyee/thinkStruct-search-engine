Furthermore, when the carcass3consists of multiple carcass plies, the position of the edge3cof the carcass turn-up portion3b, e.g., in the tire radial direction, can be the same or different among the carcass plies. The number of cords in the carcass3is not particularly limited, however, can be in the range of 20 to 60 cords/50 mm, for example. In addition, various structures can be used for the carcass lines. For example, in the tire radial direction, the carcass maximum width position can be moved closer to the bead portion2side or the tread portion5side. For example, the carcass maximum width position can be provided in the range of 50% to 90% of the tire cross-sectional height, to the outer side in the tire radial direction from the bead base line.

The young's modulus means Young's modulus relative to the tire circumferential direction and is determined in accordance with JIS L1017 8.8 (2002) by testing with JIS L1017 8.5 a) (2002). In the pneumatic radial tire for passenger vehicles with narrow-width and large-diameter, local deformation occurs in the tire circumferential direction in response to inputs from the road surface during turning, and the contact patch tends to be triangular in shape, i.e., the circumferential contact length varies greatly depending on the position in the tire width direction. In contrast, the use of a highly rigid circumferential belt layer improves the ring rigidity of the tire and suppresses the deformation in the tire circumferential direction, and for that reason, the non-compressibility of the rubber also suppresses deformation in the tire width direction, and the ground contact area is less likely to change. Furthermore, the increase in ring rigidity promotes eccentric deformation, which simultaneously increases rolling resistance. Furthermore, when using a high-rigidity circumferential belt layer as described above, the inclination angle of the belt cords of the belt layers4a,4bwith respect to the tire circumferential direction is preferably a high angle, specifically 35 degree or more. When the high-rigidity circumferential belt layer is used, the increased stiffness in the tire circumferential direction may result in reducing the ground contact length for some tires. Therefore, by using a high-angle belt layer, the out-plane flexural rigidity in the tire circumferential direction can be reduced to increase the circumferential elongation of the rubber during tread deformation, thereby reducing the reduction of the contact patch length. In this embodiment, the circumferential belt layer may also be made of wavy cords to increase breaking strength. Similarly, high elongation cords, e.g., 4.5 to 5.5% elongation at break, may be used to increase breaking strength. Furthermore, in this embodiment, a variety of materials can be employed for the circumferential belt layer and the typical examples include rayon, nylon, polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), aramid, glass fiber, carbon fiber, and steel. The organic fiber cords are particularly preferred in terms of weight reduction. Here, when a circumferential belt is provided, the cord of the circumferential belt layer can be a monofilament cord, a cord with multiple filaments drawn together, a cord with multiple filaments twisted together, or even a hybrid cord with filaments of different materials twisted together.

For example, the number of the circumferential belt layers can be increased only in the shoulder area S, while the number of the circumferential belt layers can be increased only in the center region C. In this embodiment, the circumferential belt layer can be larger, smaller, or the same in the tire width direction than the belt layers4a,4b. For example, the tire widthwise width of the circumferential belt layer can be 90% to 110% of the widthwise width of the belt layer having the maximus widthwise width of the belt layers4a,4b, the belt layer4ain the example illustrated.

Each sound absorber ( 20 a, 20 b ) includes a flexible sheet-like base material ( 54 ), a sheet-like screen material ( 52 ), and a sound absorbing material ( 56 ) disposed in a closed space formed by the sheet-like base material ( 54 ) and the sheet-like screen material ( 52 ).", "detailed_description": ["One typical solution for reducing tire cavity noise of a wheel is to adhere a layer of porous, sound-absorbing foam onto the inner surface of the tread portion of the tire. The foam layer continuously extends in the tire circumferential direction.FIG.1\u2032 is an exploded partial view of a tire10\u2032 including a continuous foam layer20\u2032 attached to the inner surface of the tread portion12\u2032 of the tire10\u2032. The continuous foam layer20\u2032 extends in the tire circumferential direction to form a substantially closed loop. This solution has been widely adopted by commercially available tires and wheels of vehicles. For example, a continuous polyurethane (PU) foam layer has been attached onto the inner tread of a vehicle tire to reduce tire cavity noise.", "", "The present disclosure found that the traditional solution such as shown inFIG.1\u2032 may have several technical shortcomings. First, the acoustic performance of polyurethane (PU) foam is relatively low compared to other fibrous acoustic material. The normal incident sound absorbing coefficient of a 25 mm thick PU foam sample in the desired frequency range 100 Hz to 300 Hz is less than 0.1. Consequently, polyurethane (PU) foam may not be a desired material for tire cavity noise reduction, though it has been widely used due to its low material cost. In addition, the labor cost for adhering the continuous PU foam layer onto the tire is another concern from the tire manufactures. To achieve a better adhesive condition, commonly a pre-process of grinding away the mold release layer (with a thickness less than 0.5 mm) on the inner surface of tread is performed before the adhering process. Consequently, the larger the area of the continuous foam layer adhering to the tire, the higher the additional labor cost. For a typical automobile tire, for example, the area to be pre-processed can be around 0.3 to 0.6 m2. The adhesive area is also proportional to the material cost of adhesive. Furthermore, when a tire with the PU foam layer is punctured, the portion of the PU foam covering the punctured area needs to be removed before the repairing work. It may be difficult and expensive to remove the whole PU foam layer and replace it with a new one. In real practice, the PU foam layer attached to the tire usually has a thickness of 25 mm and a width ranging from 150 mm to 180 mm. A typical tire perimeter may be, for example, 2.372 m. Correspondingly, the volume of the PU foam layer is 8.9\u00d710\u22123m3and the weight is 445 g, assuming the density of the PU foam is 50 kg/m3and the width is 150 mm. Such an additional weight may degrade the fuel efficiency of the tire.", "", "Some embodiments of articles and methods described herein are provided to reduce tire cavity noise while addressing the above issues for the traditional solution. The approach described herein provides a better acoustic performance in terms of a higher energy dissipation at tire cavity resonance and less additional weight effect, relative to the typical solution where a layer of porous, sound-absorbing foam is attached onto the inner surface of the tread portion of the tire.FIG.1Ais a schematic cross-sectional view of a pneumatic tire10with an array of discrete sound absorbers20a, according to one embodiment.FIG.1Bis a perspective side view of the tire10ofFIG.1A.
