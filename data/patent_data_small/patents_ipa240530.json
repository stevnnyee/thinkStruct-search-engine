The rim20is integrally made, and has two side portions21, an inner annular portion22, and an outer annular portion23. The left and right sides of the inner annular portion22are integrally connected to the bottom edges of the two side portions21, respectively. The left and right sides of the outer annular portion23are integrally connected to the top edges of the two side portions21, respectively. A predetermined distance is defined between the inner annular portion22and the outer annular portion23. The two side portions21, the inner annular portion22and the outer annular portion23jointly surround a hollow area24. The thickness of the inner annular portion22is greater than that of the side portions21to form an inner raised portion25extending toward the hollow area24. An arc-shaped abutting groove26is formed on the circumference of the inner raised portion25. The inner raised portion25enables the arc-shaped abutting groove26to be recessed. The arc-shaped abutting groove26is formed with a plurality of equally spaced spoke holes27. Each of the spoke holes27is arranged at a set angle as required, and configured to receive a spoke nipple30. The spoke nipple30has a head portion31and a neck portion32. One end of a spoke33is connected to the neck portion32. The cross section of the arc-shaped abutting groove26has a curved segment S. The curved segment S has a center O. The spoke hole27has a central axis N. The center O serves as a reference point for the central axis N to radially pass through the inner annular portion22in a fan shape. When the central axis N at a right angle is set as 0 degrees, the length of the curved segment S is greater than the range of every adjacent two of the spoke holes27at an angle of 45\u00b0 relative to the left and right sides of the central axis N, so that the surface of the curved abutting groove26can support both sides of the head portion31of the spoke nipple30. The thickness of the inner annular portion22, in a position where the central axis N perpendicularly passes through the inner annular portion22, is between 2.0 mm and 2.5 mm. With the above structure, the concave surface of the arc-shaped abutting groove26can support the head portion31of the spoke nipple30in a wide range, so that the spoke nipple30with a larger installation angle can be evenly supported and stressed, thereby avoiding damage.", "", "The assembly, function and effect of the above-mentioned embodiment are described in detail below. Referring toFIGS.4to7, the rim20of the present invention is preferably made of metal by extrusion. Except the spoke holes27, each section of the rim20shows a consistent thickness. The center O of the curved arc segment S serves as a reference point for the spoke hole27to pass through the surface of the arc-shaped abutting groove26at a set angle, that is, the central axis N is the normal of the curved segment S. In other words, both sides of the spoke hole27are symmetrical relative to the central axis N. Therefore, when the spoke nipple30is installed in the spoke hole27, the bottom edge of the head portion31is in contact with both sides of the edge of the spoke hole27. In this way, the spoke head30bears the tension of the spoke33. The arc-shaped abutting groove26enables both sides of the spoke head30to be supported and stressed evenly, so that the spoke nipple30and the spoke33can be stabilized to avoid the concentrated stress (shear force) at the junction of the spoke nipple30and the spoke33, so as to prevent the spoke nipple30and the spoke33from being damaged or to prevent the spoke33from breaking. Furthermore, the head portion31of the spoke nipple30can be stressed stably and evenly. Thus, the tensile strength that the spoke nipple30and the spoke33can bear is greater, and the rigidity effect is better. Because the spoke hole27can be arranged at any angle in the arc-shaped abutting groove26, both sides of the head portion31of the spoke nipple30can be supported and stressed evenly. The curved segment S of the arc-shaped abutting groove26is designed for drilling a hole angled at an angle of 45\u00b0 (90\u00b0 relative to the left and right sides of the central axis N. Therefore, it can meet the requirements for the spokes to be mounted between the rim and the wheel drum of the electric bicycle, so that the rim provided by the present invention can be used widely. Besides, the thickness of the inner annular portion22, in a position where the central axis N perpendicularly passes through the inner annular portion22, is between 2.0 mm and 2.5 mm. This ensures that the rim20remains rigid and its weight is under control.", "", "According to the above-mentioned creative idea, the present invention may implement and present the aspect as shown inFIG.8. An outer raised portion28protrudes from one side of the inner annular portion22away from the hollow area24. The outer raised portion28enables the rim20to be in a different shape, and enables the arc-shaped abutting groove26to be recessed inwardly. The radian of the arc-shaped abutting groove26may be larger, and the length of the curved segment S may be longer. Thus, the spoke nipple30with a larger inclination angle can be supported, so that the spoke nipple30with a large inclination angle can be supported evenly to avoid damage.", "", "Although particular embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
