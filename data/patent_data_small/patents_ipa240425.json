In addition, the inner rubber10that forms the tire inner cavity surface1A can maintain a high rolling resistance performance compared to the case where the rubber disposed radially outwardly of the carcass6is made thicker. Further, since the cross-sectional area A2(shown inFIG.2B) is greater than 1.5% of the inner-cavity cross-sectional area A1(shown inFIG.2A), the resonance of driving vibration from the road surface in the tire inner cavity100can be reduced.

When manufacturing such a tire1, the space between the outer edges11aof the two intermediate layers11can serve as a point of reference that allows accurate placement of a relatively large inner layer12in some cases.", "", "For instance, a balance between noise reduction and rolling resistance may be obtained by making the inner layer12as wide as possible, but not so wide that its axially outer edges extend beyond the outer edges of the belt plies. In more specific terms, the belt7can include a radially outer belt ply7A that is stacked on a radially inner belt ply7B. The radially outer belt ply7A has an axial width W2, and the radially inner belt ply7B has an axial width W3. The axial widths W2, W3are measured from one edge of the belt ply7A,7B to the other. The inner layer12has an axial width W4that is less than both axial widths W2, W3, i.e., less than the smallest axial width out of all the belt plies. In some cases, the smallest axial width is the axial width of the outermost belt ply, in the illustrated example the radially outer belt ply7A.", "", "A ratio between the width W4of the inner layer12and the smallest axial width of all the belt plies7A,7B can range from about 0.8 to 1.0. For example, said ratio can range from 0.90 to 0.99. In other words, the inner layer12can extend as far as the axial edges of the narrowest belt ply7A without extending past its edges. As a comparative example, a pneumatic tire with a thin rubber layer adhered to the inner surface below the tread region is considered. Similarly to the inner layer12, such a thin rubber layer may increase the weight of the tread portion and reduce pass-by noise and interior noise to a certain extent. Since the thin rubber layer is applied to the built (or even vulcanized) tire, it is difficult to target placement of the rubber layer relative to the edges of the belt. The most straightforward way to ensure that the rubber layer is placed within the outer edges of the belt is to make the axial width of the rubber layer substantially smaller than the axial width of the belt although a larger axial width may generally improve noise reduction by the rubber layer. In contrast to this, the inner layer12can be integrally formed with the rest of the tire as part of the building process, which may allow accurate placement of even a relatively wide inner layer12.", "", "The tread portion2can include one or more grooves13that extend continuously in the circumferential direction of the tire. In some instances, the inner layer12overlaps all of the circumferential grooves13. To put it another way, all of the circumferential grooves13are arranged within the axial width W4of the inner layer12. However, not all tires have continuous circumferential grooves. Some tires have a \u201cluggy\u201d pattern that consists of a large number of blocks. The principles described herein can be applied both to tires with and without continuous circumferential grooves.", "", "In some instances, the thickness T of the inner layer12can range from about 2.0 to 4.5 mm, or more specifically, 2.5 to 3.5 mm. In addition or alternatively, a ratio (T/t) between the thickness T of the inner layer12and the thickness t between the carcass6and the inner surface9in each of the sidewall portions3can range from about 1.75 to 3.5. For example, the ratio T/t can range from 1.9 to 2.7. In some cases, the thickness T and/or the thickness t may be substantially constant. For example, the inner layer12may have a substantially rectangular cross-section having a constant thickness T (not shown). In some instances, the sidewall portions3have the same thickness t on each side of the tire1.", "", "In other cases, the thickness T and/or the thickness t may vary. In this case, the aforementioned ratios and dimensions relate to the maximum thickness. For example, the inner layer12can include a central region12ahaving a substantially constant thickness T and a tapered region12barranged on each side of the central region12a. The aforementioned ratios and dimensions are based on the thickness T of the central region12ain this example. In other cases, the thickness T of the inner layer12may continuously vary along the axial direction of the tire. Again, in this case, the aforementioned ratios and dimensions are based on the maximum thickness. In such cases, the width W4of the inner layer12is measured at the point in which the thickness between the carcass6and the inner surface9is greater than the thickness tin the sidewall portion3. For example, the axial width W4includes the tapered regions12binFIG.2.", "", "Referring still toFIG.2, the inner layer12can be formed from butyl rubber that is arranged in direct contact with the carcass in a region that overlaps the belt plies, i.e., without any other layers or materials arranged between the butyl rubber and the carcass ply6A. For example, such an inner layer12can be formed using known strip winding techniques, in which one or more strips of butyl rubber are wound about an axis of the tire to form the cross-section depicted inFIGS.1and2. In some instances, the same one or more strips of butyl rubber can be wound about the tire axis to form the inner surface9along each of the sidewall portions3. Thus, it is possible to build the integral inner layer12on a tire building drum without a substantial increase in the building duration or number of steps. Such implementations can optionally further include intermediate layers11formed by a monolithic body of extruded rubber, i.e., intermediate layers11that are not formed using strip winding techniques. Extruded intermediate layers11can be applied to the strip wound butyl rubber relatively quickly. However, the principles described herein can also be applied to intermediate layers11formed by strip winding techniques as well as to an inner layer12formed by an extruded body of rubber.", "", "Further, although the drawings depict the inner layer12as a unitary component formed by a single material (e.g., butyl rubber).
