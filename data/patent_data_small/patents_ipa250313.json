The curved extension may have the same or similar benefits as the angled extension of the trumpet arm402, where the flange of both the trumpet arm402and the trumpet arm1402provide a relatively abrupt transition at the flange/arm transition, compared to the gradual transition present in a banjo axle or a Salisbury axle. The relatively abrupt transition described herein may assist in providing a substantially sized envelope in which to package electric axle components. Internal buttresses can also provide the flange/arm transition with strength and rigidity comparable to or greater than that of the banjo axle and/or the Salisbury axle, where the internal buttresses and the curved extension provide resistance to degradation of the trumpet arm, which may be caused by deflection of the trumpet arm over time.", "", "Turning toFIGS.14A and14B, a first perspective view1400and a second perspective view1450are shown of a trumpet arm1402.

The internal buttresses1408may be cast as part of the housing1412(e.g., continuous with housing1412). In some embodiments, the internal buttresses1408are formed as pieces separate from the housing1412(e.g., castings, stampings, formed pieces, machined pieces) and welded or otherwise fixedly positioned in the interior1410of the housing1412.

In some embodiments, each of the multiple through holes1416may have a raised bolt pad1418, which may assist in positioning a fastening attachment, such as a bolt, and distributed bolt loading. The raised bolt pad1418may further aid in manufacturing of the trumpet arm1402. In some embodiments, the raised pads may or may not be used. For example, a spot face may be used instead.
