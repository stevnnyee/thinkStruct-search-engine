As shown inFIG.19, the pawls106a-care in the retracted position (e.g. due to the force applied by the biasing element104) with the block232of the inserted deadband adjustment key108reducing the distance between the pawls106a-cand the fingers144a-c. As a result, the hub assembly1is in a freewheeling configuration where the hub shell assembly30(e.g. the gear180) is able to rotate clockwise with respect to the freehub body assembly100(e.g. the pawls106a-c). Indeed, because the pawls106a-care able to retract such that they do not contact the gear180, the hub assembly1is in a silent freewheeling configuration where the hub assembly1does not make a clicking noise found in traditional assemblies due to the contact of the pawls106a-cwith the gear180. As shown inFIG.19, in this configuration the pawl106ais positioned so that the pawl pusher cam surface166is in contact with the deadband surface132aand/or within the deadband cavity.

As a result, the hub assembly1is in again in a silent freewheeling configuration where the hub shell assembly30(e.g. the gear180) is able to rotate clockwise with respect to the freehub body assembly100(e.g. the pawls106a-c). However, unlike the configuration inFIG.19, the longer deadband distance inFIG.20will increase the time required for the fingers144a-cto push the pawls106a-cto the extended position and thus increase the time required for the pawls106a-cto engage the gear180thereby reducing the likelihood of pedal kickback.", "", "FIG.21is another section view of hub assembly1with the freehub body assembly100inserted (e.g. concentrically nested) within the toothed ratchet gear180according to some embodiments. As shown inFIG.21, the pawls106a-care in the extended position due to the extending force applied to the pawls106a-cby the fingers144a-covercoming the biasing force applied by the biasing element104. In particular, as the freehub body assembly100begins to rotate clockwise (e.g. due to pedaling), the one-way clutch42provides a drag or stopping force to the stem142of the pusher140such that the fingers144a-cmove counterclockwise with respect to the pawls106a-c(and the remainder of the assembly100). As a result, the fingers144a-cslide along the deadband surface132a-ctoward the pawls106a-cand eventually contact the pawls106a-c, sliding under the tip168and the surface166thereby causing the pawls106a-cto pivot away from the deadband surface132a-ctoward the teeth185of the ratchet gear180and into the extended position. When in the extended position, the pawls106a-ccontact/engage the teeth185of the ratchet gear180so that pedaling torque applied to the freehub body assembly100is transferred to the hub shell assembly30via the pawls106a-cpressing against the teeth185of the ratchet gear180(which presses against the hub shell assembly30).

Engagement deadband angle/length A is shown as the free movement of the fingers144a-cof the pawl pusher140before the ratchet pawl106ais in complete contact with ratchet gear180. Indeed, because the key108is not inserted in the key slot138, the pawl pushers140must move the maximum deadband distance in order to cause the pawls106a-cto fully extend and/or engage the ratchet gear180.", "", "As described above, when transitioning from the extended position to the retracted position, as they move counterclockwise with respect to the gear180, the pawls106a-cslide against the sliding face188of the teeth185without engaging the teeth185thereby enabling the gear180to rotate clockwise independent of the freehub body assembly100. In contrast, when transitioning from the retracted position to the extended position, as they move clockwise with respect to the gear180, once the pawls106a-cpivot such that they are able to contact the gear180, the pawls106a-ccatch/engage with one of the receiving faces186of the teeth186thereby causing the gear180to rotate clockwise due to the force of the clockwise rotation of the freehub body assembly100.", "", "FIG.22is another section view of hub assembly1with the freehub body assembly100inserted (e.g. concentrically nested) within the toothed ratchet gear180according to some embodiments. In particular,FIG.22is substantially similar toFIG.21except that the deadband adjustment key108is inserted into the key slot138thereby reducing the deadband distance. As a result, as illustrated by the reduced length B, instead of moving the longer length/angle A as shown inFIG.21, the pawl pushers140only need to move the less than maximum deadband distance/angle B in order to cause the pawls106a-cto fully extend and/or engage the ratchet gear180. Thus, the hub assembly1provides the advantage of enabling the deadband distance to be adjusted and/or configured for silent freewheeling.

In the first mode, \u201cfreewheeling,\u201d the hub1freewheels when the bicycle200is rolling forward and the pedal crank208remains stationary. The cranks208, chain212, cassette214and freehub body assembly100remain motionless relative to the bicycle frame204,206, while the rear wheel rotates forward. In the second mode, the hub1drives the bicycle200forward when the pedal cranks208are pedaled forward by the bicycle rider. The chainring209rotates and applies tension to the bicycle chain212, rotating the bicycle cassette214and freehub body assembly100, and the freehub body assembly100applies torque to the hub shell assembly30, rotating the wheel and driving the bicycle200forward. In this manner the rider propels the bicycle200forward by rotating the pedals.", "", "In further detail, as described above, the hub assembly1freewheels when the ratchet pawls106a-care in the retracted position towards the bearing assembly102, as depicted inFIG.19. Under freewheeling conditions, the hub shell assembly30rotates clockwise relative to the hub center axis6, while the freehub body assembly100remains stationary. The one-way clutch42is therefore also rotating clockwise relative to the pusher stem142. The one-way clutch42is able to be specified and installed such that it allows the pusher stem142to rotate freely in the drive (e.g. forward pedaling or clockwise direction), but locks and resists or stops rotation in the opposite direction (e.g. counter-clockwise direction). Thus, as the hub shell assembly30freewheels, the residual drag in the clutch42, which owing to the physics of any free-running clutch cannot be zero, is able to continuously rotate the pawl pusher140clockwise relative to the pawl pusher center axis147, which is nominally identical to the hub center axis6.", "", "During freewheeling, the biasing element104contacts the pawl pads164and presses the pawls106a-cinward towards the center of the hub100, allowing the ratchet gear180to rotate freely around the ratchet pawls106a-cwith no contact, and consequently no sound. In particular, as described above, the biasing element104is able to be sized such that it provides a constant inward force towards the hub center axis6on the pawl spring pads164throughout the entire free range of the pawls106a-cwithin the assembly1. This force may be controlled by sizing the resting diameter of the shape of the elongated body of the biasing element104, by choosing the strength/flexibility of the material of the biasing element104and/or the diameter of the body of the biasing element104.", "", "Depending on how the hub deadband distance has been configured, the pusher stop wall152is able to be pressed against either the freehub stop surface136or the deadband adjustment key block232(if the deadband adjustment key108is installed in the hub100). If the deadband adjustment key108is not installed, the parts of the hub will be resting in the configuration shown inFIG.20. If the deadband adjustment key108is installed, the parts will be resting in the configuration shown inFIG.19.", "", "The deadband of the hub1is developed as the rider transitions from coasting to moving the pedal cranks208and actively pedaling the bicycle200forward. As the pedal cranks208begin moving, the freehub bearing assembly102begins rotating clockwise relative to the hub center axis6, until the speed of the freehub bearing assembly102matches the rolling speed of the hub shell assembly30. Once these rotational velocities match, the pusher stem142is stationary relative to the one-way clutch42, and therefor as the one-way clutch42begins to develop a torque against the pusher stem142, and thus the pawl pusher140begins to rotates in the opposing direction (e.g. counter-clockwise) relative to the freehub bearing assembly102. As this rotation occurs, the pusher cam surface166of the pawls106a-cmoves towards and comes into contact with the pawl surface148of the pusher fingers144a-c. Once this happens the ratchet pawls106a-cbegin to pivot about the pawl cylinder160, such that the pawl tip radius170moves outward towards the ratchet gear180. Since the ratchet gear180may still be rotating relative to the freehub bearing assembly102, the pawl tip radius170contacts the ratchet gear180in a random location based on when the pedal stroke is started, the speed of the wheel, and other factors. Once this contact occurs, the pawl tip radius170slides over the ratchet tooth sliding face188until the pawl driving surface168contacts the ratchet tooth receiving face186. Once this contact occurs, torque is transferred from the freehub bearing assembly102to the hub shell assembly30via the ratchet pawls106a-cin compression against the teeth185.", "", "Once underway, the rider may cease pedaling to resume freewheeling. When torque is no longer applied to the freehub bearing assembly102, the ratchet gear180resumes (e.g. clockwise) rotation relative to the freehub bearing assembly102, and the ratchet pawl106is forced away from the ratchet ring180as the pawl tip radius170slides back down the ratchet tooth sliding face188(and/or due to the inward biasing force applied by the biasing element104). Simultaneously, the pawl pusher140is free to rotate (e.g. clockwise) with the hub shell assembly30, and is able to be helped along by the sliding contact between the pawl surface148of the pusher140and the pusher cam surface166of the pawls106a-c. Once the ratchet pawls106a-chave moved to the retracted position, the pawl pusher140continues rotating clockwise relative to the freehub bearing assembly102owing to the parasitic free-running drag between the pusher stem142and the one-way clutch42.", "", "FIG.23illustrates a method of providing a hub assembly1according to some embodiments.
