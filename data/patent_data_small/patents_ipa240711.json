The methods for casting aluminum wheels according to the present disclosure use increased silicon content, a grain refiner including aluminum-titanium-vanadium-boron (Al\u2014Ti\u2014V\u2014B), and/or a die cast tool with an increased cooling rate to improve feeding efficiency.", "", "Referring now toFIG.1, aluminum (Al) dendrites50are formed during casting. The Al dendrites include a primary arm54and secondary arms58. Spacing (\u03bb2) between the secondary arms58is referred to as second dendrite arm spacing (SDAS), which is a good indicator of a cooling rate of the Al of the cast wheel.", "", "Referring now toFIGS.2A and2B, groups of Al dendrites form during casting. Spoke regions of low pressure die cast (LPDC) Al wheels show a high percentage of casting defects due to insufficient feeding efficiency of the melt. When the Al dendrites50have large grain sizes, the Al dendrites50reduce the flow efficiency of the melt within the die. Insufficient feeding efficiency leads to shrinkage porosity. Shrinkage porosity acts a crack initiator.", "", "In addition, mechanical properties of the spoke region are sensitive to impurity iron (Fe) content. Impurity Fe combines with aluminum and silicon (Si) atoms to form a Fe-rich phase that acts as a crack initiator in deformation (e.g., degrading fracture toughness, ductility, and/or fatigue durability of the cast aluminum wheels). In addition, a slower cooling rate leads to a coarse Fe-rich phase, which impedes feeding of the melt. This, in turn, leads to larger shrinkage porosity and degraded mechanical properties of the cast Al wheels.", "", "Increased sustainability and reduced energy consumption are strong incentives for increasing the use of Al scrap when manufacturing cast Al wheels. However, the scrap Al tends to have higher levels of impurity Fe content. Typically, LPDC Al wheels are limited to less than 0.15% Fe content, which limits the use of Al scrap which typically has a higher Fe content.", "", "Methods for casting Al wheels according to the present disclosure improve feeding efficiency of the melt to reduce shrinkage porosity and/or reduce sensitivity of mechanical properties of the Al wheel to Fe content. More particularly, the methods for casting Al wheels according to the present disclosure use increased silicon content, a grain refiner (e.g., aluminum-titanium-vanadium-boron (Al\u2014Ti\u2014V\u2014B)), and/or a die cast tool with an increased cooling rate to improve feeding efficiency.", "", "The increased silicon content reduces the solidus temperature and increases a flow length before solidification ends. In addition, the grain refiner adds inoculant particles to provide nucleation substrates for aluminum grains. In some examples, the die cast tool can be made using tooling steel with increased thermal conductivity to provide more uniform temperature in various locations of the die during casting. As a result, the melt can flow more efficiently through the die before solidifying since cold spots and/or large temperature gradients in the die are reduced.", "", "Aluminum wheels cast using LPDC typically use a grain refiner such as Al5Ti1B. However, the grain refiner Al5Ti1B tends to significantly increase grain sizes as the Si content increases. In contrast, the grain refiner Al\u2014Ti\u2014V\u2014B reduces grain size with increasing Si content. For example, a first spoke cast using 7% Si content and Al5Ti1B with a secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) of approximately 40 \u03bcm produced an average grain size of over 600 um. For example, a second spoke cast using 7% Si content and Al\u2014Ti\u2014V\u2014B with a SDAS of approximately 40 \u03bcm produced an average grain size of over 400 um. For example, a third spoke cast using 9% Si content and Al\u2014Ti\u2014V\u2014B with a SDAS of approximately 40 \u03bcm. In addition, the methods described herein have an average grain size that is less than 400 \u03bcm.", "", "Cooling rate is another important enabler for significantly improving feeding efficiency. For example, a fourth spoke cast using 9% Si content and Al\u2014Ti\u2014V\u2014B with a SDAS of approximately 20 \u03bcm produced an average grain size of less than 250 um. Grain size smaller than 250 um will be very desirable for reducing sensitivity of spoke region to Fe content.", "", "Referring now toFIG.3, a method250for tilt casting an aluminum wheel is shown.

The rear hub (1) between the body (2) and the freehub body (4) comprises a connecting part (5a) and a freewheel system (6). In this \u2018ratchet\u2019 type of rear hub, the freewheel system (6) works through the interaction between the connecting part (5a), which is normally externally threaded and has internal splines, and the two rings (6a,6b) facing each other, with external splines and laterally toothed with equal and complementary lateral teeth, pushed by two springs (6c) external to them, which make up the freewheel system (6) as shown inFIG.1A. The connecting part (5a) which is normally threaded externally for fastening to the body (2) and internally splined for holding the freewheel system (6), is the most important part in the connection and fastening of the freehub body (4) to the body (2). As a result, and based on the workload it undergoes after continued use, it generates problems when it has to be replaced, as mentioned above.", "", "Therefore, the invention refers to a bicycle wheel rear hub (1) that also comprises a cylindrical body (2) that surrounds an axle (3) and where at a distal end (2a) it comprises a distal stop (1a) and at a proximal end (2b) a freehub body (4) is attached by means of a connecting mechanism (5), where the freehub body (4) comprises a cylindrical body, a freewheel system (6) within it and a proximal stop (1b) at a proximal end (4b) of the freehub body (4). However, as shown inFIG.2, the body (2) of the rear hub (1) of the invention is characterized in that the connecting mechanism (5) between the body (2) and the freewheel system (6) comprises a connecting crown (7) and an elastic ring (8), which are the key innovative parts of the invention.", "", "On the one hand and preferably, the connecting crown (7) comprises an external crenellated and/or splined surface (7a), an inner radially toothed surface (7b) and a lateral surface (7c). The external crenellated and/or splined surface (7a) and the internal toothed surface (7b) act as a support and link between the body (2) of the hub (1) and the rings (6a,6b) of the freehub body (4) responsible for the effect of the freewheel system (6), ensuring the solidity and firmness necessary for holding the freehub body (4), by means of a sliding adjustment. In other words, the outer surface (7a) and inner surface (7b) require shapes which may be regular or irregular, but which must be complementary to the surfaces with which they are going to be matched. The lateral surface (7c) comprises a circular recess (9) where the elastic ring (8) is attached or seated.", "", "Also, preferably, the crenellated and/or splined outer surface (7a) of the connecting crown (7) is complementary to the inner surface (2c) of the body (2), while the inner radial surface (7b) of the connecting crown (7) is toothed and complementary to the outer surface of the ring (6a) of the freewheel system (6) as seen inFIG.3.", "", "On the other hand, as shown inFIGS.3and4, the elastic ring (8) of the rear hub (1) of the invention comprises a circular flat body with two free ends (8a,8b) so as to be able to expand towards the inner surface (2c) of the body (2) and fit into a groove or channel (2d) in the inner radial surface (2c) of the proximal end (2b) of the body (2) of the hub (1) and block the sliding movement of the connecting crown (7), guaranteeing the absolute immobility of the connecting crown (7) inside the body (2).

In other words, the first ring (6a) fits externally with the complementary splines of the inner radial surface (7b) of the connecting crown (7) and the second ring (6b) fits laterally with the complementary teeth of the first ring (6a) and externally with the inner surface of the freehub body (4). The teeth of the rings (6a,6b) form a wedge shape, one side being inclined and the other straight. In this way, when pedalling on the bicycle, the sprockets make the freehub body (4) turn and thus turn the rings (6a,6b) of the freewheel system (6), which are facing each other and in contact due to the fact that the springs (6c) are partially extended, exerting pressure on one ring (6a) against the other (6b). Therefore, when the pedals turn in the direction of travel, the teeth mesh, turning the body (2) and with it the bicycle wheel. However, when pedalling is stopped or reversed, the springs (6c) are slightly compressed and the freewheel system (6) disengages releasing and allowing both rings (6a,6b) to slide, since the teeth rotate in the opposite direction allowing the wheel to turn when the pedals are immobile or rotate in the opposite direction to the direction of travel.", "", "Another possible embodiment of the invention is when the freehub body (4) comprises at least one pawl system on an external surface of the distal end (4a) and the connecting crown (7) comprises an inner radially toothed surface (7b) complementary to the pawls of the freehub body (4). Alternatively, in another embodiment, the connecting crown (7) comprises a lateral radially toothed surface (7c) complementary to the outer surface of a ring (6b) of the free wheel system (6), where in this case, the use of one of the toothed rings (6a) is eliminated, being the connecting crown (7) the connecting mechanism (5) and ring (6a) at the same time.", "", "Additionally, as shown in the Figures, the rear hub (1) of the invention comprises wheel bearings (11,12) on the axle (3), where the wheel bearings (11) are those located inside the body (2) and the wheel bearings (12) are those located inside the freehub body (4), allowing and helping them to rotate when necessary.", "", "For all of the above and thanks to the connecting mechanism (5) of the invention, the problem of over-tightening of the threaded connecting part (5a) is solved, facilitating the disassembly and replacement of the necessary parts without the need for tools or special knowledge, thus simplifying and reducing the cost of maintenance work.
