A handle is provided on a surface of the barrel that similarly avoids attachment points along the radii through which the lug bores are formed.", "detailed_description": ["Agricultural vehicles such as wagons, trailers, tractors and a wide variety of other implements use ground contacting wheels to move on unimproved surfaces. For example, agricultural vehicles are frequently in fields, dirt roads and other locations where service and repair of equipment are unable to easily tread. As these wheels and tires require maintenance, this is frequently performed without the assistance of machinery, such as jacks or lifts, to remove and install the wheels from the vehicle.", "", "To remove and install agricultural wheels on such unimproved locations, manpower is generally required to lift the wheels and tires for installation, removal and related maintenance. The softer soils and remote locations frequently make support machinery to change and install wheels impractical or not suited to the conditions and task without damage to the ground and risk to man and machine from the less than ideal conditions.", "", "Additionally, the forces and stresses applied to agricultural wheels are different from typical, on-the-road tires and wheels. An agricultural wheel may experience significant lateral stresses. However, to resist the stresses additional support is needed, but the low weight needed for manual installation is also an important design consideration.", "", "Most other prior art wheels must be precisely balanced due to the rate at which they rotate. Even a slight imbalance of a wheel may cause vibration and shorten the life of both the tire and the wheel. However, on slower agricultural wheels, such as the present design, some imbalance is tolerated. This allows the present designed to incorporate a handle affixed to the wheel to provide a fixture to aid in manipulating the wheel. This is not practical on typical higher velocity wheels.", "", "While this invention may be practiced in many different forms, there are described in detail herein specific embodiments of the invention. This description is exemplary of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the particular embodiments illustrated and described.", "", "For the purpose of this disclosure, like reference numerals in the figures shall refer to like features unless otherwise indicated or is obvious by context.", "", "The subject device and method of use is sometimes referred to as the device, the invention, the agricultural wheel, the \u2018ag\u2019 wheel, the wheel, the rim, the machine or other similar terms. These terms may be used interchangeably as context requires and from use the intent becomes apparent. The masculine can sometimes refer to the feminine and neuter and vice versa. The plural may include the singular and singular the plural as appropriate from a fair and reasonable interpretation in the situation.", "", "Referring now to the drawings, where the present invention is generally referred to with numeral10, it can be observed that it basically includes a wheel assembly12, a lug bore14, an axle bore16, a valve stem18, a disc20, gussets22, a handle24, a wall26, a tire28, a barrel34, flanges32, bead seats34, a radius R1, a radius R2and a radius R3.", "", "FIG.1shows an elevation view of an example of the agricultural wheel. A tire28is affixed over the bead seat34of the flange32. A valve stem18passes through the wall26allowing the tire28to be inflated and deflated as needed. Similar to other tires, an axle bore16may be provided in the center of the disc20.", "", "The axle bore16supports the agricultural wheel on the vehicle or trailer axle or axle bearings.", "", "A series of lug bores14penetrate through the disc the20and provide a means to affix the agricultural wheel to the axle hub. Generally, the axle hub will have threaded fasteners that pass through the lug bores14. Lug nuts, not shown in the drawings, firmly attach the agricultural wheel disc22the axle hub.", "", "A plurality of the gussets22span between the disc20and the barrel30provide rigidity and structural support of the agricultural wheel without adding significant weight. As noted above, a gusset22may not be possible in a higher velocity wheel because the potential imbalance could cause excessive vibration. The gussets22are permanently affixed between the disc20in the barrel30by welding, brazing, casting in place or other available metallurgical attachment processes.", "", "In a version of the design, the entirety of the agricultural wheel, including gussets22, barrel30, wall26and other associated elements are made of steel. The barrel30, along with the wall26, bead seat34and flange32may be pressure rolled into the appropriate profile and diameter. The disc20is formed of a complementary diameter to fit within the barrel30. The disc30is then welded onto the barrel30. For further support, gussets22are then affixed between the disc20in the barrel30. The gussets22are generally oriented along a radius of the disc30.", "", "At least one handle24is affixed to the agricultural wheel on either the wall26, as shown inFIG.2, or on to the disc20. In a closely related embodiment shown inFIG.3, the handle24is affixed to the wall26on the opposite side of the agricultural wheel as the gussets22are affixed. Depending on the weight of the agricultural wheel and tire combination, the mechanical equipment available to aid in installation and removal and the operator's preference, the handle24may be either on the inside of the agricultural wheel, closer to the body of the vehicle, or on the outside.", "", "During the process of changing the agricultural wheel from a vehicle, the wheel may be laid flat on the ground next to the vehicle. By having the handle24on the outside surface of the wheel, it is exposed when the wheel is raised from the horizontal position on the ground to the vertical position immediately prior to being affixed onto the vehicle hub. This allows the installer of the wheel to continually have access to the handle24during the more difficult part of the installation process to manipulate the lug bores14over the axle lug bolts on the hub.", "", "Generally, the gussets22are triangular-shaped. The gussets22connect the barrel30to the disc22provide rigidity. In the example shown inFIG.1, there are five gussets22that match the number of lug bores14. Imaginary radius R1passes from the center of the axle bore16through a first gusset22. Imaginary radius R2passes from the center of the axle bore16through a second, adjacent gusset22. Imaginary radius R3passes from the axle bore16through the lug bore14, between the two adjacent gussets laying on R1and R2. In this way, the gussets22do not lie on a radius through any axle bore16.", "", "The strength of the agricultural wheel is improved by positioning the gussets22on radii between the lug bores14. Similarly, the handle24is not affixed to the agricultural wheel on or about radius R3passing through the lug bore14. The axes of rigidity along radius R1and radius R2are reinforced by the orientation of the corresponding gussets22that each have an edge along the respective radius. By avoiding the lug bore14along these radii R1and R2structural integrity is enhanced and failure potentially derived from the lug bore14apertures are avoided.", "", "As shown inFIG.3, the position of the handle24avoids the radius R3over the lug bore14benefits the structure of the wheel regardless of whether the gussets22are on the same side of the wheel as the handle24. This is true because the forces acting along radius R3, passing through the lug bores14, are avoided. The lineal strength along radii R1and R2is maintained through the uncompromised structure of the disc20by avoiding the weaker lug bores14.", "", "Wheels with more or less than five lug bores14equally fall within the inventive concept. By having a number of gussets22corresponding to the number of the lug bores14, the radius R1and R2along which the gussets22are oriented can be maintained between and avoiding the radii R3that pass through the lug bores14. For example, having for, five, six or eight lug bores14may readily be utilized with an equal number of gussets22between the radii R3on which the lug bores14are positioned.", "", "An important version of the invention can be fairly described as an agricultural wheel comprised of, among other elements, a disc, a barrel, a handle and a plurality of gussets. The barrel is circular or toroidal shaped in that the barrel is configured to meet with the bead of a tire mounted onto the wheel. A tire will have matching beads on each of the interior edges of the tire that mate with the flange and bead seat on the exterior or circumference of the wheel. The circumference of the barrel at the bead seat matches the circumference of the inner edges of the tire so that a tight seal is formed between the bead seat on the wheel and the tire. An example of the barrel cross-section can be seen clearly inFIG.2. The barrel, from the flange through the bead seat and wall is able to be formed on a roller press and then welded end to end to form the circular shape with the flange, bead seat and wall profiles formed therein. The disc is generally circular and fits well into the interior circumference of the barrel. The exterior circumference of the disc is then welded to the interior circumference of the barrel to form a unified wheel structure. A plurality of gussets reinforces the connection between the disc in the barrel. Generally, the orientation of the gussets is parallel to the radius of the wheel through the center point. The disc includes a plurality of the lug bores oriented around an imaginary center point of the wheel. When installing the wheel, the axle threaded lugs pass through the axle bores where a lug nut affixes the wheel to the axle. Then the axle bore through the center of the disc may also be provided to allow easier access to the axle bearings. Each lug bore lies on an imaginary lug radius emanating from the center point of the disc. It is along these lug radii that the wheel is most at risk to fail under stress. Therefore, the gussets are affixed between the barrel and the disc at approximately a midpoint between two adjacent lug radii. Similarly, the handle is affixed to the exterior surface of the barrel at attachment points that avoid landing on any lug radii. The handle may be placed on either or both sides of the disc while still avoiding attachment points along the lug radii.", "", "The foregoing description conveys the best understanding of the objectives and advantages of the present invention.

For instance, the wheel hub display device can display high quality images, videos, graphic effects, and so on at the wheel of a vehicle. In addition, the wheel hub display device can account for various wheel physics and dynamics in rendering the high quality images. For example, the wheel hub display device can perform a transformation of the content based on: (i) a refresh rate associated with the display device, and (ii) a motion parameter associated with the vehicle. For example, the wheel hub display device can rotate the displayed image (e.g., with respect to the rotational velocity of the wheel) such that the image appears stationary to an observer outside a vehicle as the wheels of the vehicle rotate. As another example, certain effects can be generated with respect to physics of the wheels such that the effects reflect or respond to the motion of the vehicle. For example, the transformation can include a rotation of the content in a direction opposite of a rotation direction of the wheel.", "", "According to example aspects of the disclosure, the content to be presented on a display screen of the wheel hub display device can be based on a user input.

A software application (e.g., on a user device, on a vehicle computing system, etc.) can provide operators of a vehicle with generative tools to design and modify different display effects with wheel hub display devices on the wheels of the vehicle. For instance, the application can provide operators of the vehicle with tools to choose what content to display on each wheel hub display device, including user-designed content and generated content from a generative model. The generative model can be any suitable generative model, such as a generative adversarial network (GAN), stable diffusion, or other model.

For instance, vehicles, computing devices, and methods according to example aspects of the disclosure can decrease computational resource usage associated with transmitting and/or storing images for wheel hub display devices at a vehicle. The use of a generative model can provide for the generation of new content at the vehicle itself, which can provide for powerful customization options to be made available to the operator of the vehicle without requiring that the vehicle store extensive data to facilitate those customization options.

In this regard, the recess9is designed in such a way that it can essentially completely accommodate a volume of the radially pretensionable element10in an elastically stressed state.", "", "By way of example, the radially pretensionable element10is designed here as a circlip11(seeFIG.1B), which can be made from a plastic, a plastic mixture, a metal or a metal alloy, for example. The wheel bearing hub5has a guide surface13, a constriction diameter14and a conical peripheral surface15on an inside diameter12, wherein the constriction diameter14is smaller than the inside diameter12of the wheel bearing hub5, but larger than the outside diameter8of the constant velocity joint3.", "", "The guide surface13is formed in an inclined, e.g., conical, manner such that the radially pretensionable element slides along the guide surface13when the constant velocity joint3is inserted into the wheel bearing hub5and is thus gradually elastically compressed. The gradual elastic compression of the radially pretensionable element10makes it easier to guide it through the constriction diameter14.

Due to the conical, i.e., oblique in the longitudinal section, course of the conical peripheral surface15, the radial force17acting perpendicularly on the conical peripheral surface15results in an axial force18acting in the axial direction A, which braces the wheel bearing hub5and the constant velocity joint3minimally or slightly against one another in an assembly direction M.

The axial force18causes the wheel bearing hub5and the constant velocity joint3to be braced against one another in the tooth-on-tooth position during the assembly of the wheel bearing unit1in such a way that the constant velocity joint3does not fall out of the wheel bearing hub5again. A tooth-in-tooth position, which can also be referred to as a tooth-in-gap position, can be produced by a rotational relative movement between the wheel bearing hub5and the constant velocity joint3, wherein the axial force18is designed to axially pretension the wheel bearing hub5and the constant velocity joint3against one another also in the tooth-in-tooth position, thus preventing the constant velocity joint3from falling out of the wheel bearing hub5also in the tooth-in-tooth position.", "", "Furthermore, the wheel bearing hub5has a trailing surface19which is arranged downstream of the conical peripheral surface15as viewed in the assembly direction M. The trailing surface19can either be formed as oppositely conical (seeFIGS.1A,3and4) with respect to the conical peripheral surface15or substantially cylindrical (seeFIGS.2A and2B). The trailing surface19is used to accommodate the radially pretensionable element10after the assembly of the wheel bearing unit1, e.g., after the wheel bearing hub5and the constant velocity joint3have been braced by a bracing element20, such as a clamping screw, and thus prevent the radially pretensionable element10from slipping out of the recess9. For example, the oppositely conically shaped trailing surface19can elastically stress, inFIGS.1A,3and4, elastically compress, the radially pretensionable element10in such a way that the radially pretensionable element10is braced in the recess in such a way that it is essentially unable to move in the operating state of the wheel bearing unit1.

An end portion of the stub axle is externally-threaded32aso as to accept the wheelnut26which has a corresponding internal thread. Also visible inFIGS.2&3, normally concealed beneath the trim element30, is the locking pin42. This is an annular element which locates within the central hollow space of the stub axle32and which has external spline formations44which match corresponding internal spline formations on the stub axle32and the wheelnut26. Thus, once inserted axially inwardly, the splines engage and the locking pin thus bridges from the stub axle32to the wheelnut26to prevent relative rotation and keep the wheelnut26engaged on the stub axle32.", "", "It then remains to find a way to remove the locking pin42when it becomes necessary to remove the wheel10(and hence the wheelnut26).

On its inner face there is a bearing surface which contacts the wheelnut26, shaped so as to minimise wear of the wheelnut26. The annular disc shape of the spacer tool46defines a central hole48, through which can extend an engagement tool50. This has an external thread which can engage with a corresponding internal thread on the locking pin42, and an externally-accessible engagement element52which (in this example) is a square-section recess able to receive standard-sized ratchet tools, breaker bars and the like.

The locking pin42is in place within the annular interior space defined by the hollow stub axle32and the wheelnut26, external splines44aand44bengaging with corresponding internal splines on the stub axle32and wheelnut26. Note that, in this example, the two splines44aand44bare different in size, with a step54between them, so that the spline44bwhich engages with the stub axle32is narrower than the spline44awhich engages with the wheelnut26. However, this need not necessarily be the case and other arrangements are possible which employ a single external spline on the locking pin which extends through matching internal splines on the stub axle and wheelnut.", "", "The engagement tool50extends into the central axis of the locking pin42and has an external thread54which has just about engaged with an internal thread56on an inner cylindrical surface of the locking pin42.

Rotation of the engagement tool50then further engages its thread54with the thread56of the locking pin42. Since the engagement tool50cannot be drawn further into the assembly, due to the presence of the spacer tool46abutting against the wheelnut26and the step58, the locking pin42must instead be withdrawn from the stub axle32and wheelnut26.FIG.6shows the arrangement after further rotation, with the locking pin42withdrawn sufficient to completely disengage the spline44awith the wheelnut26and almost disengage the spline44bwith the stub axle32.

Sudden shock loads are avoided entirely.", "", "Another benefit of this invention is that a simple, inexpensive and lightweight spacer tool46can be provided that enables a standard engagement tool50to be employed within the process, simply by selecting the dimensions of the spacer tool as required in the light of the dimensions of a standard engagement tool50and the other elements of the wheel hub, nut etc. Such engagement tools are provided to workshops and recovery staff, and may be incorporated within the toolkit provided in the vehicle.

Alternatively, the spacer tool46could be retained on the engagement tool50as a permanent or semi-permanent part thereof. Such a combined spacer tool and engagement tool could be an integral body, or the spacer tool could be freely rotatable around the engagement tool.
