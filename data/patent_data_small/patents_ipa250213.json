Generally, the novel hub and spoke arrangement provides three areas of contact between portions of a spoke and a flange extending from the hub. The first area of contact is between a head of the spoke and the flange. The second area of contact occurs between an arcuate inner radius segment of the spoke commonly referred to as the \u201cJ\u201d bend area and the flange. The third area of contact occurs between an extension segment of the spoke (downstream from the J bend area) and another area of the flange. It is believed the three areas of contact arrangement between the flanges of the hub and each of the spokes advantageously provides increased resistance to the breakage of the spokes at the J bend area due to vibration and load cycling during wheel rotation under load and also address shimmy.", "", "Referring now toFIG.1, a bicycle wheel is illustrated generally at10. The bicycle wheel10is conventional in the art and will only be briefly described herein. The bicycle wheel10is configured for rotational support by a frame (not shown) and includes a conventional hub12, a plurality of spokes14and a circumferential outer rim16.", "", "Referring now toFIG.2, the conventional hub12includes an axle20supported for rotation within a hub shaft22. Opposing first and second flanges24,26extend radially from the hub shaft22.

In a similar manner, the second flange26includes a plurality of second flange apertures30arranged in a circumferential pattern adjacent an outer perimeter32of the second flange26. Each of the plurality of first and second flange apertures28,30has a circular cross-sectional shape. As will be discussed in more detail below, each of the plurality of first and second flange apertures28,30is configured to receive a portion of a spoke therethrough and further configured to seat a head of a spoke (referenceFIG.5).", "", "Referring now toFIGS.3A and3B, a conventional spoke14is illustrated. The spoke14includes a first end40, an opposing second end42and a body44extending therebetween. The first end40includes a head45, a bent section46(commonly called a J bend section), and an extension segment54. The head45includes a tapered portion49that connects to the J bend section46.", "", "Referring again toFIGS.3A and3B, the second end42of the spoke14includes a threaded portion43.

The J bend section46includes a first segment50that extends from the tapered portion49of the head45, a radiused segment52extending from the first segment50to an extension segment54. The radiused segment52has an arcuate inner radius segment53having a distance R1.", "", "Referring now toFIG.5, a portion of the conventional hub12is illustrated with an installed conventional spoke14in a \u201chead in\u201d arrangement. The hub12includes the axle20, the hub shaft22and the first flange24. The first flange24includes the plurality of circumferential first flange apertures28. In the \u201chead in\u201d arrangement, the head45of the spoke14is arranged in an inward position relative to the first flange24. Further to this arrangement, the tapered portion49of the spoke14seats in one of the first flange apertures28, thereby forming a first area of contact58between the head45of the spoke14and the first flange24. In the installed position, the first segment50of the spoke14extends through the first flange aperture28. Also in the installed position, the arcuate inner radius segment53of the radiused segment52contacts a wall defining the first flange aperture28, thereby forming a second area of contact60between the spoke14and the first flange24.", "", "Referring again toFIG.5, in the installed arrangement the extension segment54extends in a direction away from the radiused segment52and toward the outer rim (not shown for purposes of clarity). In the installed arrangement, the extension segment54forms a gap62with an outer face64of the first flange24. The gap64results in a lack of contact between the extension segment54of the spoke14and the first flange24. The gap62extends continuously along the length of the extension segment54from the first flange aperture28to the body44of the spoke. Without being held to the theory, it is believed the lack of contact and support between the extension segment54and the first flange24contributes to breakage of the spokes14at the J bend section46due to vibration and load cycling during wheel rotation under load.", "", "In accordance with the invention, a novel hub and spoke arrangement for a bicycle is presented. Generally, the novel hub and spoke arrangement provides three areas of contact between portions of a spoke and a flange extending from the hub. Without being held to the theory, it is believed the additional third area of contact contributes to the prevention of vibration-related breakage of the spokes at the J bend section due to vibration and load cycling during wheel rotation under load. Advantageously, the three areas of contact arrangement facilitate the use of low spoke counts, with each of the spokes under extremely high static tensions. The use of low spoke counts, each at extremely high static tensions, provides an aerodynamic advantage not seen in conventional hub and spoke arrangements having higher spoke counts with lower spoke static tensions. As will be discussed in more detail below, it should be appreciated that the additional third area of contact can be formed in various manners.", "", "Referring now toFIG.6, a first embodiment of a novel hub and spoke arrangement for a bicycle is shown generally at100. The novel hub and spoke arrangement100includes the conventional axle20, the hub shaft22and the first flange24. The first flange24includes the plurality of circumferential first flange apertures28as described above. A spoke114includes a first end140, an opposing second end (not shown for purposes of clarity) and a body144extending therebetween. In this embodiment, the spoke114is one of a plurality of spokes in a quantity of about 10 to spokes per wheel. Each of the spokes114is tensioned in a range of about 300 lbs. to about 500 lbs. However, it should be appreciated in other embodiments, the number of spokes per wheel can be less than about10or more than about 12 and the tension of each spoke can be less than about 300 lbs. or more than about 500 lbs., sufficient for the functions described herein. The first end140includes a head145, a J bend section146and an extension segment154. The head145includes a tapered portion149that extends to a first segment150. The tapered portion149has a circular cross-sectional shape.", "", "Referring again to the embodiment shown inFIG.6, the J bend section146includes the first segment150that extends from the tapered portion149of the head145, a radiused segment152extending from the first segment150to the extension segment154. The radiused segment152has a circular cross-sectional shape and an inner radius153having a distance R2. The distance R2of the radiused segment152of the spoke114is smaller than the inner radius R1of the radiused segment52of the spoke14shown in prior art ofFIG.5. In other words, the smaller inner radius53results in closing the arcuate inner radius153, in contrast to conventional wheel building practices. The smaller radius R2of the radiused segment152of the spoke114results in the novel formation of three areas of contact with the first flange24. The first area of contact, shown at160, is formed at the area the tapered portion149of the head145contacts an annular wall defining a first flange aperture28. The second area of contact, shown at162, is formed as the arcuate inner radius segment153of the radiused segment152contacts the same wall defining the first flange aperture28. The third area of contact, shown at164, is formed as a portion of the extension section154contacts a portion of the first flange24.", "", "Referring again toFIG.6, it should be appreciated that the terms \u201cfirst, second and third areas of contact\u201d can have different configurations depending on the structure of the contacting elements. It is contemplated that the area of contact can be a singular point, a linear segment of contact or a geometrically-shaped contact form. As a first example, the first area of contact160is defined above as the location where the tapered portion149of the head145contacts a wall defining the first flange aperture28. As the tapered portion149of the head145has a circular cross-sectional shape and the wall defining the first flange aperture28also has a circular cross-sectional shape, it should be appreciated that the \u201cfirst area of contact\u201d could have the form of a linear segment, in this example an arcuate linear segment, rather than a singular point of contact. As another example, the second area of contact162is defined above as the location where the arcuate inner radius segment153of the radiused segment152contacts the same wall defining the first flange aperture28. As the arcuate inner radius segment153of the radiused segment152has a circular cross-sectional shape and the wall defining the first flange aperture28also has a circular cross-sectional shape, it should be appreciated that the \u201csecond area of contact\u201d could have the form of a linear segment of contact, also in this example an arcuate linear segment rather than a singular point of contact. As a final example, the third area of contact164is formed between a portion of the extension section154and the first flange24. In the embodiment shown inFIG.6, the extension section154has a circular cross-sectional shape and the first flange24forms a circular outer rim. Accordingly, the third area of contact has the form of a singular point of contact, rather than a linear segment of contact.", "", "Referring now toFIG.7, the hub12is centered about a vertical plane A-A that includes the outer rim16(FIG.1). The spoke114, forming the three areas of contact160,162and164with the first flange24extends to and is connected to the outer rim16(FIG.1). The three areas of contact160,162and164are positioned outside the vertical plane A-A. The hub12also includes the second flange26. A second spoke115is situated with the second flange26in a manner similar to the spoke114with the first flange24and also forms three areas of contact166,168and170with the second flange26. The three areas of contact166,168and170are on opposite sides of the vertical plane A-A as the areas of contact160,162and164. Without being held to the theory, it is believed that in addition to each of the sets of three contacts160,162,164and166,168,170contributing to the prevention of vibration-related breakage of the spokes at the J bend sections due to vibration and load cycling during wheel rotation under load, but also the opposed relationship of the sets of three contacts160,162,164and166,168,170on either side of the vertical plane A-A further contributes to the stability provided to the J bend sections during load cycling during wheel rotation under load.", "", "Referring again to the embodiment shown inFIGS.6and7, it should be appreciated that the smaller arcuate inner radius153can be formed with various methods. In one non-limiting example, the hub of an assembled wheel incorporating the novel hub and spoke arrangement can be subjected to lateral forces sufficient to displace the hub in a corresponding direction, thereby decreasing the arcuate inner radius of the outward spokes and forcing contact of the extension portions of the spokes with the associated flange. Once the force is applied in the first direction, the hub can be subjected to lateral forces in the opposing direction to affect the decreasing of the arcuate inner radius of the opposing side spokes.", "", "As another non-limiting example of forming the smaller arcuate inner radius, it is contemplated that the spokes can be pre-formed prior to assembly with the hub.", "", "While the embodiment of the novel hub and spoke arrangement shown inFIGS.6and7contemplate the use of flanges of conventional hubs, it is further contemplated that the third area of contact can be formed from hubs incorporating other structures, mechanisms, and devices. Referring now toFIG.8, a second embodiment of a novel hub and spoke arrangement is provided at200. The novel hub and spoke arrangement200includes a first flange224and a spoke214. The first flange224includes the plurality of circumferential first flange apertures28as described above. As described above, a head245of the spoke214seats within the first flange aperture28. The first flange224includes an inner face290, an outer face292and an outer edge296. The inner face290and the outer face292can be substantially parallel with each other, although such is not necessary. The outer edge296includes a nub298, configured to extend from the outer face292in a direction toward the extension segment254. In an installed orientation, the nub298contacts the extension segment254of the spoke214, thereby forming a third of contact264between the spoke214and the first flange224.", "", "In the embodiment illustrated inFIG.8, the nub298has a squared cross-sectional shape sufficient to seat against a portion of the extension segment254. However, in other embodiments, the nub298can have other cross-sectional shapes. Referring now toFIG.9in another embodiment, a nub398formed on a first flange324illustrates another non-limiting example in the form of a nub398having a rounded cross-sectional shape. It should be apparent that the size and cross-sectional shape of the nub398need only to be sufficient to contact the extension segment354of the spoke314, thereby forming the third area of contact364.", "", "Referring to the embodiments shown inFIGS.6-9, each of the spokes114,214and314has a \u201chead-in\u201d orientation.

That is, since the breaking durability against the projection input of the tread portion 1 during traveling is improved, shock burst resistance can be improved. When the elongation at break of the carcass cord is less than 20%, the effect of improving the shock burst resistance cannot be obtained.
