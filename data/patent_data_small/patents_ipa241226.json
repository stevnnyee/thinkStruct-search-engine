In particular, the invention uses reflective surfaces in new ways to selectively reflect features to alter the visible characteristics of the wheel. Moreover, the technical approach permits the substitution of different features or coloring for further customization.", "", "Referring now to the drawings, which are shown for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present invention only and not for the purposes of limiting the same,FIGS.1A-1Eare pictorial diagrams showing several views of an exemplary embodiment of a vehicle wheel100in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.

In one or more embodiments, base150includes one or more contoured reflective surfaces106. In one or more embodiments, rim110includes an inner lip136and an outer lip138. Outer lip138faces an outside environment5(shown inFIG.1C), and inner lip136is positioned opposite of outer lip138on rim110so that inner lip136faces an undercarriage of a vehicle (e.g., undercarriage of vehicle9shown inFIG.2C) when wheel100is mounted on the vehicle. In one or more embodiments, wheel100may also include a hubcap108, which covers at least a portion of mount102to at least prevent dirt and moisture from accumulating on and damaging mount102. In one or more embodiments, wheel100may also include a cavity114. Cavity114may be defined by at least base106and/or rim110.

In one or more embodiments, reflective surface106is concave or parabolic, so that reflected ray10reflects outside of cavity114and into outside environment5without colored surface152being visible to outside environment5.", "", "Selective display of colored surface152may be performed by determining the spatial positioning of reflective surface106and positioning or angling of desired colored surface152such that an optical path vector intersects the desired portion of colored surface152. Such calculations may involve determining the angle or position of reflective surface106and the corresponding relation to the position of colored surface152as well as the desired optical path. Once determined, angling colored surface152may involve positioning colored substrate104on wheel100until the desired reflection (e.g., reflected color10) occurs or such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. In one or more embodiments, colored substrate104may be positioned relative to reflective surface106so that the optical path vector of, for example, reflected color10, exits cavity114relatively perpendicular to central axis A.

The coupling of the stationary outermost shell62to the first rotating shell64and the coupling of the second rotating shell66with the third rotating shell68are both structural in nature, and thus require the support of a larger additional bearing74,76, respectively. The coupling of the first rotating shell64with the second rotating shell66, by contrast, is a means of connecting the two structures together to form the steering assembly60, and therefore requires only the second ring bearing65without the support of an additional larger bearing.

The design of the bicycle distributes the forces on the frame and front forks further apart than a conventional bicycle frame. The bearing and structure around the primary pivot50can thus be lightweight and compact because the other pivots51,52,53act to support and brace the primary pivot50whilst simultaneously allowing the degree of freedom required for steering the bicycle. The steering assembly may thus be more efficient, utilising less materials, and have a lighter structure whilst exhibiting improved structural strength. A conventional bicycle frame experiences a concentration of forces on one axis in the head tube through which the handles turn the front wheel. The head tube also has to be of sufficient length, diameter, or strength, to retain the front fork within their constraints. By dividing the force across two separate axes, the bicycle can instead use a very short, lightweight head tube, which in turn allows for a greater magnitude of suspension of the front wheel, which is no longer impeded by the head tube. The steering braces in the bicycle allow for a front fork that is rigid enough to support a front swing arm suspension. The bicycle suspension can be extended to hold the wheel in a lowered configuration (e.g.FIGS.39A to39F) or contracted to hold the wheel in an elevated configuration (e.g.FIGS.40A to40F). The front swing arm suspension design acts as a passive anti-dive arrangement that uses the torsional forces generated from braking to counter the diving tendency caused by the forward movement of the centre of mass when braking.", "", "The principles disclosed above in relation to the steering assembly60can also be extended to applications beyond vehicle wheel steering to axial positioning in general.
