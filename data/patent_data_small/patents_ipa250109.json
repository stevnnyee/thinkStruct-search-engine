The conventional wisdom of tire design of a tire having good wear was to provide a tire with each of the ribs having a similar contact surface ratio. In order to provide adequate wet hydroplane performance, large open longitudinal grooves and ample lateral grooves provided space for water egress as the tread rolls through the contact patch. Interfering with this egress, by providing longitudinal bridging or other features within these longitudinal blocks, would have been thought to impede water egress and increase the potential for tire hydroplaning (where the tire would decrease or lose its contact with the ground surface, and therefore loose traction).", "", "The novel light truck tire presented surprisingly possesses remarkably reduced wear compared to such prior art sculpture designs, while maintaining or even improving upon wet hydroplane traction, snow and dry traction performance. Such performance improvement is not anticipated by the design of a tire that occludes longitudinal groove water evacuation and limit lateral grooves in one or more central ribs. The tire's solid central rib provides a ridged rubber interface with the ground surface. Since it is understood that tire wear occurs as the tread block slips as it enters and exits the contact patch, providing a central rib lacking lateral grooves provided the expected improvement of reduced tire wear. The solid central rib, or ribs in the case of the present embodiment, help further reduce deformation of the tread rubber under the heavy loading and heavy torque of light truck tire loading. This reduces the rubber shear strain at the trialing edge of the contact patch while providing the necessary longitudinal and or transversal forces required for vehicle motion. The increased rib rigidity reduces the slip between the tire tread surface20and the ground surface as the rubber exits tire contact patch. These two effects reduce the tire tread wear as shown inFIG.8even under the demanding power and torque performances of modern light truck tires.", "", "FIG.8shows a graph of predictive tire wear based on testing of the tires under real life conditions. The data is obtained by subjecting test tires to wear on actual on-road travel over an abbreviated duration as specified in the horizontal axis and measuring tread wear periodically during the testing. Based on the rate of tread wear, as measured by the tread depth, the predictive milage, shown on the vertical axis, is calculated at which point the model predicts the tread will have reached at least 2/32 tread depth, representing the tread life of the tire. As can be seen in the figure, the witness tire (W) represents a light truck tire having a tread sculpture represented byFIG.7. The inventive tread sculpture is represented by E1of the figure. A significant increase in tread wear performance is observed, with the predictive model having a similar upward slope, representing a similar reduced tread wear rate as the tire wears. The inventive tread sculpture having a tread compound having increased compression set is represented by E2in the graph. The unexpected improvement is shown by the marked increase of slope of the wear graph line of E2. This represents that the wear rate is similar to E1initially, as would be expected, but improves dramatically as the tire tread experiences compression set. The rubber, over time, plastically deforms under dynamic conditions and due to the poison effect, the sipes' gaps in the tread close. This phenomenon causes the tread blocks to lock up and have an overall increase in effective tread stiffness, synergistically improving tread wear.", "", "The wet braking performance of a tire mounted on an automobile fitted with an ABS braking system is measured by determining the distance necessary to go from 40 mph to a complete stop upon sudden braking on a wetted (no puddles) asphalt surface.

Generally, a higher contact surface area would be expected to decrease wet braking performance. The applicant hypothesize that the increase hydro performance is due to the higher contact surface ratio in the center of the tire, and, relative to the center, a lower contact surface ratio in the shoulders, combined with lateral groove feature in the shoulders which it is hypothesized has a similar effect to that of \u201crounding\u201d the contact patch. As such, the water is pushed by the tire from the centerline of the tire at the beginning of the contact patch to the outside shoulder areas where the water is evacuated by the lateral and longitudinal features. The intermittent bridges allow for limited but adequate water evacuation in the central portion of the tire toward the middle of the contact patch. This hydro-performance, however, was not anticipated, and the applicant's initial expectation was a decrease of hydro-performance due to the increased contact surface ratio and longitudinal grooves interrupted by lateral bridging.", "", "Snow performance was evaluated by a \u201cGM spin test\u201d and a subjective snow handling test. GM spin testing was performed to evaluate the inventive tread sculpture compared to the prior art witness sculpture. The grip on snow-covered ground is evaluated by measuring the forces on a single driven axle test in snow according to the ASTM F1805 test method. The vehicle travels at a constant 5 mph speed and the forces are measured on the single test tire at the target slip. A value greater than that of the Standard Reference Test Tire (SRTT), which is arbitrarily set to 100, indicates an improved result, i.e., improved grip on snow. Subjective snow testing was performed by a Lateral acceleration under snow conditions is measured objectively using accelerometers during vehicle testing along a testing course. During such testing, at least 5 laps along a road course were conducted by different drivers, where subjective snow handling measures were provided by the drivers according to SAE standards while accelerometers were used to measure acceleration, deceleration, and lateral accelerations along predefined segments along the testing course. The data was filtered and averaged to provide accurate results.", "", "Both the GM spin test and the subjective snow handling test showed an unexpected similar performance to that of the prior art tread sculpture. With reduced lateral voids, a tire designer would expect the ability for the tire to \u201cbite\u201d into the snow to be reduced. This reduced lateral void would mean less traction on snow for subjective handling and it would be expected to reduce the performance of the GM spin test. What was found during testing, however, was different than what was expected. In GM Spin testing, there was not a significant difference between the tire with the inventive sculpture and the prior art witness. During subjective snow handling, the inventive tire was credited with a 0.5-point advantage over the witness tire. In particular the bridged center section is believed to provide areas for snow packing despite the reduced lateral grooves and the bridged portions provide an additional lateral edge for additional snow traction.", "", "To the extent used, the terms \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201chaving,\u201d or any variation thereof, as used in the claims and/or specification herein, shall be considered as indicating an open group that may include other elements not specified.
