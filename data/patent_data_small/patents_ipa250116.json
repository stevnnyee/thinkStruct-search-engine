Spoke hole width122allows the portion of nipple190around nipple opening192to pass through spoke hole120, but does not allow collar196to pass through spoke hole120, such that nipple is retained in spoke hole120by the tension of spoke150on nipple190once tube170is threaded into nipple190.FIG.3also shows spoke threads174which inter-engage with nipple threads194in thread tube170into nipple190.

However, because each spoke150extends at angle250to plane230, each spoke150extends from its tube170at angle250to tube axis172. This means that there is a bend in spoke150at an angle250at the point320where spoke150protrudes from tube170. With steel spokes, such a bend would weaken the spoke and ultimately cause the spoke to fail. However, with spokes150, such a bend does not damage spokes150, because fibers152are flexible and resilient yet strong such that spokes150retain their integrity and strength even when bent under tension in the manner described. Therefore, spokes150can bend without weakening or failing. Furthermore, each of spokes150is three times as strong, and weighs half as much, as a steel spoke that would otherwise be used in its place. This allows the width158of each of spokes150to be greater than that of a steel spoke that would be used in its place. In the alternative, the width158of each spoke150may be less than or equal to the width of a steel spoke that would be used in its place; the strength of each of spokes150may be greater or less than three times that of a steel spoke that would be used in its place; and the weight of each of spokes150may be greater or less than half that of a steel spoke that would be used in its place.", "", "Rim110, hub130, tube170, anchor180and nipple190, in a preferred embodiment, are made of aluminum. Alternatively, any of rim110, hub130, tube170, anchor180or nipple190may be made of any other material of comparable strength. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, fibers152are a bundle of thermotropic liquid crystal fibers that exhibit high strength, low creep, and weather resistance. For instance, the fibers could be PBO fiber such as Zylon\u00ae, a strong yet lightweight fiber, available from Toyobo. Alternatively, fibers152may be made of any other material having comparable weight and strength. Jacket154is made of Rilsan\u00ae, a high performance polyamide.

Fibers152are gathered in forty-four (44) bundles410of nine-hundred ninety-six (996) fibers152in each bundle, for a total of 43,824 fibers152in spoke150. This great number of fibers152is one factor contributing to the great strength of spoke150, while minimizing the weight of spoke150. Spoke150has a breaking strength of 3,600 pounds.

As can be appreciated fromFIG.5, the width of rim110is just slightly wider than the width of nipple190. As a result, it is necessary that nipple190be aligned so that the spoke150extends radically inward from rim110. Because of this positioning, it is important that spoke150be flexible as it leaves nipple190so as to accommodate angle250without any decrease in strength and durability. Due to the number of fibers152contained within spoke150, there is no noticeable decrease in strength despite the off-axis tension.", "", "When tension is applied to spoke150, collar196strikes the inside surface of rim110and maintains the nipple190, and corresponding sleeve, in its perpendicular arrangement.", "", "Referring toFIG.6, an alternative embodiment of the flexible spoke is shown and generally designated700. Spoke700consists of a tube770having threads774, an anchor780, and a jacket702. When mounted into rim110, threads774engage with threads194(not shown, seeFIG.5) in nipple790. Tube770having threads774, anchor780, and nipple790are substantially similar to tube170having threads174, anchor180, and nipple190as described and fully detailed above inFIGS.1-5, respectively. In this alternative embodiment, jacket702is formed in the shape of a teardrop (seeFIG.7). As is known in the industry, teardrop shapes are efficient due to the reduced amount of drag produced by the flow of air over the shape. In this embodiment, jacket702consists of a leading edge714and a trailing edge716. When spoke700in installed in wheel100, spoke700is oriented such that leading edge714points in direction102, which is the direction of rotation of wheel100. It is to be appreciated that trailing edge716points in the direction opposite direction102.", "", "In this embodiment, the teardrop shape creates less drag than a typical round spoke due the reduced drag created by the teardrop shaped jacket702. Less drag is due to the reduced wake created when spoke700rotates through air as compared to a typical round spoke. A typical round spoke has only 50% of the drag of a flat plate traveling at the same rate through the air. However, a properly dimensioned teardrop shape has 5% or less of the drag of a flat plate traveling at the same rate through the air. Even an improperly dimensioned teardrop shape has approximately 5%-20% of the drag of a flat plate traveling at the same rate through the air.", "", "During typical bicycle racing, riders can achieve speeds of 40 mph. For a typical wheel, this means that the outer end of spoke700is also traveling at approximately 40 mph thereby creating increased drag as measured when moving away from the hub of the wheel. Assuming a racing bike wheel has a diameter of 22 inches, 40 mph roughly translates into the rim portion of the wheel rotating at 704 inches per second, meaning that the outer portion of a spoke is also moving through the air at approximately 704 inches per second. In contrast, the portion of the spoke measured at 6 inches from the center of the wheel's hub is traveling at 333 inches per second. When racing, this increased drag caused by round spokes moving at the above mentioned speeds reduces the bicycle's speed thereby requiring the expending of more energy to maintain the desired speed of 40 mph. As the number of spokes is increased, the amount of drag created by the spokes also increases.", "", "To minimize the amount of drag created by the round spokes moving through the air, an aerodynamic jacket is applied to the spoke. InFIG.6, a teardrop jacket702is shown applied to a spoke700. When jacket702is properly applied to the spoke700such that leading edge714travels in direction102, spoke700will have greatly reduced drag effects, up to 95% less than round spokes without an aerodynamic cover. The reduced drag results in a reduced amount of energy required to maintain any given speed. Alternatively, a higher speed may be achieved when applying the same amount of energy to a wheel having typical round spokes. This reduced drag effect will be a substantial benefit to a person racing on a bike with aerodynamic spokes as compared to a person racing without aerodynamic spokes since, in part, the difference between 1st place and 10th place in a bicycle race can be one (1) second or less. Over the course of a bicycle race, the reduced drag can result in decreasing race times by several seconds.", "", "Moving on toFIG.7, a cross-section of the spoke700taken through line7-7ofFIG.6is shown.
