Stated another way, the adjustment angle A is equal to the greater of the first angular distance340or the second angular distance344subtracted from the smaller of the second angular distance344or the first angular distance304. As a nonlimiting example, in the illustrated embodiment, the greater second angular distance344less the smaller first angular distance340equals the adjustment angle A (or 27.69\u00b0\u221225.71\u00b0=1.98\u00b0). The same adjustment angle A is calculated by (360\u00b0/(N*X)) or (360\u00b0/(14*13)), which equals approximately 1.98\u00b0. It should be appreciated that the adjustment angle A can be modified by increasing (or decreasing) the number of projections168,176on each side156,160(or one or both sides) of the angle adjustment member148. For example, increasing the number of first projections168on the first side156to nineteen (or N=19) and the number of second projections176on the second side160to eighteen (or X=18) changes the adjustment angle A to approximately 1.05\u00b0 (or (360\u00b0/(19*18))=1.05\u00b0). It should be appreciated that in other examples of embodiments, the number of projections168,176can be modified on either (or both) sides of the angle adjustment member148to any suitable number to achieve a targeted or desired adjustment angle A. Thus, in one example of an embodiment, the number of first projections168on the first side156(or N projections) can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, or 26 or more.

However, the number of first projections168on the first side156does not equal the number of second projections176on the second side160(or N\u2260X). Stated another way, the number of first projections168on the first side156is different than the number of second projections176on the second side160. For example, the number of first projections168on the first side156can be greater than (or less than) the number of second projections176on the second side160(e.g., N>X, or N<X).", "", "To facilitate proper alignment of the angle adjustment member148to the first mounting member140and the second mounting member144, the projections and recesses of the mounting members140,144are each respectively keyed to (or configured to interlock with) the projections and recesses of one of the sides of the angle adjustment member148.

The second line CS2shows another exemplary line of removal of elastomer composition thickness in the second subarea302\u2032. Both removals according to CS1and CS2result in a combined removal of material thickness (i.e., thickness of elastomer composition, particularly rubber composition) according to the line CS12which is essentially the sum of the thickness removals of CS1and CS2.

Preferably, movement of the laser beam in parallel lines in one direction and an opposite direction alternates. To obtain two laterally partially shifted subareas, a switch-on and/or switch-off delay of the laser may be used. In the present example, the laser may be configured to remove material thickness in a circular contour wherein a switch-on and/or switch-off delay of the laser beam results in two partially laterally shifted circular contours (shifted along a direction of the lines).", "", "Similarly, it is possible to create the third and the fourth subareas303\u2032 and304\u2032.

It also includes proper selection of the antenna length for the transponder operating frequency (915 MHz or 868 MHz). The transponder response frequency is very sensitive to antenna length and dielectric properties of nearby materials. For a coil antenna, the coil pitch can also strong influence the performance and frequency bandwidth. This becomes apparent during manufacturing where variations in construction and length of the fabricated antenna can occur. In addition, assembly of the monitoring device100can produce variations in the antenna length which can affect the already narrow RF bandwidth.

Moreover, the bandwidth is wide enough to cover both the 868 and 915 MHz (UHF) applications in NA and EU. Many advantages are offered by utilizing this wideband. If the frequency range can be shifted, then a single monitoring device design can be used for tires in both NA and EU.
