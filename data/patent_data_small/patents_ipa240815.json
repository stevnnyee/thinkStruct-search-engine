By disengaging the axle shaft bolts, the wheel hubs are allowed to spin independently from the axle shafts and the rest of the gear train. The shafts may be too large to fully remove and doing so will allow lubricant to escape and contamination to enter the system. Additionally, for a vehicle operator attempting to operate the disconnect system, there may be insufficient space on a roadside to remove an entire axle. The disconnect system may use a snap ring and a series of grooves to both retain the axle shaft in the assembly while maintaining the sealing system for the lubricant as well as securing an air gap to eliminate contact between the stationary axle shaft and free spinning full float hub. Once the bolts are disengaged the axle shaft can be pulled outward until the snap ring is engaged into the groove to positively locate and avoid contact with the hub. One method is to use one groove in the shaft and one in the side gear. In the installed condition, which includes the wheel hub spinning dependently with the axle, the clip is compressed and inboard of the side gear groove. Once the bolts are disengaged and in an uninstalled condition, the shaft can be pulled outboard until the clip snaps into the groove. Another embodiment may include two grooves in the side gear, one groove in the axle shaft and one snap ring. The clip may expand in both the installed condition as well as the towing condition (e.g., uninstalled condition) in its respective grooves eliminating stress on the snap ring in constant compression. As such, a longevity of the system may be increased. An additional system is to use an oversized width groove in the side gear, a groove in the shaft and one snap ring that allows the shaft to float outboard and a spring or other method would apply pressure pushing the shaft outboard avoiding contact with the hub.", "", "FIGS.1-4Bshow example configurations with relative positioning of the various components.
