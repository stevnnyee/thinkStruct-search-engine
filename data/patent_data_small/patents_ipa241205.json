At their inner end pointing radially inward toward the axis of rotation20of the wheel, the ventilation holes17are essentially pointed with a rounded hole tip21with a comparatively narrow hole tip radius rmin. Starting from the first, inner pitch circle18towards the second, outer pitch circle19, the hole width of the ventilation holes increases, and namely to a maximum hole width bmax, which lies on a third pitch circle22, which is located between the first and the second pitch circle18,19. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the ratio of the distance a between the first and the third pitch circle to the hole height h of the ventilation holes17, thus the distance between the first and second pitch circle, is thereby less than/equal to 0.47. The maximum width bmax of the ventilation holes17is thus closer to the first than to the second pitch circle. In their respective radially outer region, the ventilation holes are provided with a flattening23located towards the second pitch circle19, which flattening merges with outer radii of curvature R into lateral hole regions.", "", "The ventilation holes are axially symmetrical to the radial plane E defining the hole height h.

The overall shape of the ventilation holes can be described as drop- or egg-shaped.", "", "In addition to the special shape of the ventilation holes, the design of the wheel disc according to the invention is characterized by a special ratio of the material thickness in the sectional area24lying radially inward of the first pitch circle18to the material thickness at the hub connection flange11, wherein this material thickness ratio explained below has an independent inventive character. As can be seen in particular inFIG.1, the material thickness DN at the hub connection flange is essentially constant. In the sectional area24adjoining the hub connection flange11on the outside, the material thickness DA continuously reduces to less than 0.46 of the material thickness DN at the hub connection flange, wherein this minimum material thickness DA is reached approximately halfway between the transition from the hub connection flange11to the inner sectional area24and the first pitch circle18. From there, the thickness increases again to a value D1, which then reaches at least 50% of the material thickness DN at the hub connection flange at the first pitch circle18and which is preferably greater than 0.54 times of the thickness DN at the hub connection flange there. By reducing the material thickness in the sectional area24lying radially inward of the first pitch circle18to less than half, actually less than 46%, of the thickness DN of the hub connection, stresses in this part of the wheel disc10are minimized and, surprisingly, a particularly good stability of the wheel is achieved with a reduced weight compared to known wheels.
