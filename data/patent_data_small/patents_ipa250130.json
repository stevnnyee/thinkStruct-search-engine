In particular, embodiments described herein provide bicycle rims and wheels that exhibit increased stall angles and reduced drag over a greater range of wind angles in comparison to previous rims and wheels.", "", "Before proceeding, it may be helpful to define several phrases used when discussing the aerodynamics of bicycles. Meteorological (true) wind angle: wind angle experienced by a stationary observer. In this definition, the direction the observer faces is 0 degrees. Meteorological wind is the angle from which the wind is blowing naturally. Apparent wind: air flow felt by the cyclists because of the combination of the meteorological wind and the movement of the cyclist. Apparent wind angle: the angle of the actual flow of air acting on the wheels of a moving cyclist. Because the observer (cyclist) is moving, the apparent wind is the relative angle of the wind in relation to the observer. Yaw angle: the angle of airflow when the wheel orientation front to back is zero degrees. Assuming a moving cyclist, yaw angle is the same as apparent wind angle. Stall angle: the yaw angle at which airflow cannot remain laminar as it both passes over and exits the wheel surface. Laminar airflow is advantageous and increases the aerodynamic efficiency of the wheel and results in faster rider speeds for a given effort. Non-laminar airflow is turbulent and decreases aerodynamic efficiency. Non-laminar airflow slows a rider's speed at a given amount of effort.", "", "FIG.1illustrates the concepts of apparent wind and yaw (apparent wind angle). Apparent wind is the wind experienced by an object from the combination of the object moving through air and meteorological wind blowing on the object. InFIG.1, a cyclist100is riding in direction105at 27 mph and the wind indicated at115is blowing at 10 mph at angle120, in this example \u221230\u00b0 to cyclist100(for purposes of this disclosure, negative angles are to the left of the bicycle and positive angles are to the right of the bicycle). The wind felt by cyclist100is a combination of airflow created by the cyclist's movement and the meteorological wind. In this example, the bicycle will encounter an apparent wind122of 36 mph at an apparent wind angle125(also referred to as yaw) of \u22128\u00b0. If the cyclist slows down to 24 mph, but the meteorological wind stays the same, the apparent wind will be 33 mph with an apparent wind angle of \u22128.7\u00b0. This shift in apparent wind angle occurs because the meteorological wind becomes a relatively larger component of the apparent wind.", "", "The velocity of apparent wind can be characterized by EQN 1 as follows:", "", "A=((W*(cos\u2061(a)-V)^2+(W*sin\u2061(a))^2)^.5[EQN\u20621]", "", "where:W=meteorological wind speeda=angle of meteorological wind to rider where 0=headwind and 180=tailwindV=velocity of the rider", "", "The apparent wind angle or yaw can be characterized by:", "", "b=arccos\u2061(W\u2062cos\u2062a-V(W\u2062cos\u2062a-V)2+(W\u2062sin\u2062a)2)", "", "where b=apparent wind angle.", "", "When a bicycle is in motion, airflow over a bicycle's wheels results from the apparent wind. For wheels that are designed to be aerodynamic only in a head wind, the airflow over the wheel will be relatively smooth for angles close to head-on, but become turbulent at greater angles, thereby increasing drag. The angle relative to the wheel at which this transition from attached to disturbed flow occurs is referred to as the stall angle. Apparent winds having a yaw greater than the stall angle result in increased drag.", "", "Embodiments of bicycle wheels described herein can exhibit increased stall angles and therefore maintain aerodynamic efficiency through a greater range of conditions. Various embodiments of bicycle rims described herein can be shaped to seat a tire of a selected size or range of sizes. The rim is shaped so that the rim is wider than the tire at or proximate to the outer edge of the rim. This allows the tire to act as a fairing for the wheel to promote attached airflow along the rim. Additionally, the rim can be shaped so that there is a tangent line that is tangent to the tire and a sidewall of the rim. The tangent line can be tangent to the sidewall at any desired point along the sidewall of the rim including at the widest part of the rim or other point along the sidewall.

Additionally, the hollow structure in the tire is designed to enable the tire tread to yield, providing a strong ground-gripping force when the tire is in contact with the ground. Specifically, the multidimensional support structure in the tire can provide strong elastic support when the tread is under pressure. After being under pressure, the multidimensional support structure can map out multiple support points on the tire tread in reverse, forming multiple support points. This allows for during driving with the tire not only contact between the tire tread and the road surface, but also dispersed and reinforced contact of multiple support points. This increases more effective and strong contact surfaces between the tire tread and the road surface, thereby increasing tire friction of the tire and effectively preventing the tire from slipping during operation.", "", "When this tire is applied to a forklift, it is made of the tire elastomer material with a Shore hardness of 93 A.

The first annular cavities and the second annular cavities are closely connected to form three load-bearing units that can sequentially transfer load. Additionally, a concave-convex design of the tire wall is achieved via the distribution of the bulges and recessed portions, enlarging the tire wall width and increasing multiple support points. This improves the overall structural strength and elastic cushioning capability of the tire, enhancing the load-bearing capacity and impact-resistance capacity of the tire, and improving the driving comfort. In addition, multiple deformation spaces are provided on the tire wall for the tire to deform under pressure, providing a favorable condition for stress transfer when the tire is under pressure. Thus, when the tire is driven in different environments, the stress can be quickly released through deformation, reducing high-temperature damage due to stress concentration, thereby improving the driving safety of the tire and prolonging the service life of the tire.", "", "The above description shows merely preferred embodiments of the present invention and is not intended to limit the technical scope of the present invention.
