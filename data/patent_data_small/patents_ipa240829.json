As used herein, the term \u201clonger length\u201d can mean that the resonator140has a length L that is long enough to wrap around the hub120two or more times (in other words, the length L is greater than two times the circumference of the hub120). Referring toFIG.6B, an example of a resonator140having a longer length L and being wrapped multiple times around the hub120is shown. In arrangements where the resonator140is a quarter-wave length resonator140, a characteristic of the quarter-wavelength resonator140is its ability to have multiple resonance modes for a longer length L. Because the frequency interval is inversely proportional to the length L, the longer the resonator140is, the smaller the frequency intervals become such that many resonance peaks appear in a given frequency range, and the more resonance frequencies are observed by the resonator140. For example, the fundamental resonance mode (e.g., the fundamental frequency) is f0. Higher-mode resonances occur in increasing intervals of 2*f0. For example, higher-mode resonances occur at 3*f0, 5*f0, 7*f0, etc. Since the higher-mode resonances are multiples of the fundamental resonance, in some instances, it may be advantageous to design the resonator to have the lowest possible fundamental resonance mode. This allows the resonator to have many more higher-mode resonance frequencies for the same length of the resonator body.", "", "Referring now toFIGS.7A-7C, examples of the acoustic spectra of some of the variations described herein are shown.FIG.7Ashows an acoustic spectrum of the sound produced within a cavity130of a tire110without a resonator140.
