Element6F, being the rightmost element, is acted on in substantially only a shearing direction, and bottommost element shown inFIG.10K, is acted on substantially only in compression.

Efficient and immediate transfer of energy may be beneficial when there is sufficient traction to propel the vehicle. In cases where maintaining traction is problematic, such as when driving on smooth services or when loads are light reducing frictional forces, a softer transfer of shearing forces from the hub to the rim may be preferable.

Instant power transfer, such as that from electric motors, can result in slipping.

The tire innerliner is tasked with helping to mitigate the migration of gas molecules from the interior of the tire air chamber into the ambient environment. The innerliner makes up approximately 10% of the weight of the tire, so elimination of the innerliner will lower the weight of the tire. The innerliner additionally helps to insulate the tire and makes it harder for the tire to shed heat. Elimination of the innerliner may make the tire shed heat more easily.
