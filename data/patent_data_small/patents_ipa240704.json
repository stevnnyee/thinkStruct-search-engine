The tab42can be bent to a locked position (FIGS.2and7). In the initial, unlocked position, the tab42acts as a poka-yoke, or a safety feature, that prevents the end cap26from connecting to the housing24.

When a vehicle travels over various road obstacles such as potholes, curbs, and bumps, the road obstacle may cause a vehicle's wheel to travel upwards, resulting in an upwards vertical force acting on the vehicle axle. After the vehicle's wheel reaches the end of its upward travel, the wheel may travel in a downward direction, resulting in downwards vertical forces114band114d, for example, to act on the vehicle axle. Additionally, rotational forces116aand116bmay result when the vertical forces acting on either end of the axle are in opposite directions. For example, the combination of an upward vertical force114aon one end of the axle with a downward vertical force114don the other end of the axle may result in rotational forces116aand116bthat rotate in opposite directions to produce torsional loads on the vehicle twist beam axle.

In the schematic ofFIG.2A, this may mean that the first cylinder202may not move toward the left or right without the second cylinder204also moving in the same direction. Restricting the cylinders' movement in this way may help prevent the cylinders from sliding out of the depicted configuration, thereby reducing the risk that the rotating component disassembles during operation or that the rotating component's ability to decouple jounce and torsion is reduced.", "", "Axle parts206and208may be fixedly attached to the first202and second204cylinders, respectively. Once attached, the relative rotation of the first and second cylinders may extend to axle parts206and208, thus allowing the axle parts206and208to also rotate relative to one another. As a result, the relative rotation of the axle parts206and208via the first202and second204cylinders of the rotating component200may dissipate torsion loads that may act on the axle parts and/or the rotating component. In various embodiments, axle parts206and208may correspond to axle parts104and106ofFIG.1.", "", "Although the rotating component inFIG.2Ais illustrated with two bearings, various embodiments may include fewer or more bearings. The bearings may be mechanical components positioned between the first202and second204cylinders that facilitate rotational movement of the cylinders relative to one another. In other words, the bearings may facilitate one of the two cylinders rotating in a clockwise manner while the other cylinder remains stationary or rotates in a counter-clockwise manner, if viewed from the left ofFIG.2Afor example.", "", "In various embodiments, the bearings210and212may also help fix the first and second cylinders202and204in a direction of the shared axis by restricting translational motion from the first and second cylinders, at least relative to each other and the bearings, which may be achieved in various ways. For example, the friction between the inner rings of the bearings and the first cylinder may be high enough to only allow very little, if any, translational motion from the first cylinder. As a result, this may restrict the first cylinder from sliding back and forth through the bearings' central openings and potentially even slide out of the bearings altogether. The bearings may be configured to securely fit the first cylinder in order to achieve the friction necessary to restrict translational motion of the first cylinder. For example, the first cylinder may initially be loosely inserted through the central openings of the bearings, but the diameters of the bearings may then be reduced such that they securely fit the first cylinder. This may be achieved, for example, by having screws on the bearings that may be tightened to reduce the diameter of the bearings. The screws may initially be loosened to insert the first cylinder through the bearings' central openings, and then subsequently tightened to secure the bearings to the first cylinder. Various embodiments may also use other approaches to securely fit the first cylinder into the central openings of the bearings. For example, the bearings may be mounted using techniques such as press fitting or shrink fitting the bearing onto the cylinder. The specific technique used to mount the bearings may consider that the more accurately the bearings are mounted, such as the closer the bearings are mounted at right angles to the first cylinder202, the axle and rotating component200may provide, when incorporated into a vehicle, better toe and camber control. Additionally, fasteners may also be used to secure the first cylinder to the bearing and restrict translational motion along the shared axis, thus helping to fix the first cylinder in a direction of the shared axis. In various embodiments, the bearings may also be preloaded in order to ensure adequate contact with the first cylinder. The specific preload may be adjusted as appropriate for various applications, but consideration may be given that increasing preload may eventually lead to increased friction between the bearings and the first cylinder202that may damage the components and reduce operable lifetime. However, sufficient preload may be required to prevent the first cylinder202from sliding out of the bearings210and212. Since the bearings may be positioned between the first and second cylinders, the second cylinder may be in contact with the exterior of the bearings' outer rings. The second cylinder may thus be secured to the bearings' outer rings, which may be achieved in various manners similar to how the bearings are secured to the first cylinder. As a result, the first and second cylinders may rely on being secured to the bearings and the bearings' structure to restrict translational motion along the shared axis while still enabling the cylinders to be relatively rotatable.", "", "The bearings may have a circular shape and may be positioned at some distance from one another. For example, in various embodiments with two bearings, such as the exemplary embodiment illustrated inFIG.2A, the bearings may be positioned at the ends of the first cylinder, or at the ends of the section of the first cylinder that may be positioned inside the second cylinder. More generally, the bearings may be positioned between the first and second cylinders at particular locations so as to avoid a section where a bending moment caused by a jounce load is greatest so that the cylinders are able to support the bending moment. However, the specific distance between the bearings may depend on a variety of factors in various embodiments, such as the magnitude of the jounce load experienced by the first and second cylinders, or the size of the bearings, among many others.", "", "In various embodiments, the bearings may include multiple components. For example, the bearings may include an inner ring and outer ring with a rolling element between the inner and outer rings. The rolling element may refer to a variety of different elements, such as balls, cylindrical rollers, spherical rollers, tapered rollers, or needle rollers, among many others. The inner and outer rings may rotate along the rolling element, or one of the rings may rotate along the rolling element while the other is held stationary. Thus, the rolling element may facilitate the rotation of the inner and outer rings relative to one another. The bearings may also include a plurality of rolling elements, and thus the bearings may further include a cage between the inner and outer rings to prevent the rolling elements from coming into contact with one another. The surfaces of the inner and outer rings that come in contact with the rolling element may be lubricated in order to reduce the friction between those components. The inner ring may also include a central opening that the first cylinder may be positioned into. The first cylinder, after being positioned through the central opening, may then be positioned inside of the second cylinder, resulting in the bearings being positioned between the first and second cylinders. The first cylinder of the rotating component may then be secured to the inner ring while the second cylinder of the rotating component may be secured to the outer ring, as discussed further below. With the rolling element facilitating the rotation between the inner and outer rings, the cylinders being secured to the inner and outer rings may in turn mean that the rolling element also facilitates the rotation of the cylinders relative to one another. As such, the inner and outer rings of the bearings may be a third and fourth cylinder positioned around the component facilitating rotation, with the third cylinder (or inner ring) attached to the first cylinder while the fourth cylinder (outer ring) is attached to the second cylinder. The rolling element facilitating rotation of the inner and outer rings relative to one another may thus mean the rolling element is the component facilitating the rotation of the first and second cylinders.

The wheels may then act as barriers restricting the axle parts from moving along the shared axis, which consequently, may also restrict the first and second cylinders of the rotating component from moving along the shared axis.
