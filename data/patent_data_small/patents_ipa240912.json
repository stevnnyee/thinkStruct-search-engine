The hub shell14is rotatable about the axle9and includes at least two axially spaced hub flanges16aand16b, each of which include a means for connecting with a multiplicity of spokes2connected thereto. Axle9includes end faces11aand11bthat define the spacing of its mounting with the frame (not shown). The axial axis28is the axial centerline of rotation of the bicycle wheel1. The hub flanges16aand16bmay be contiguous with the hub shell14or may be separately formed and assembled to the hub body12portion of the hub shell14. Each spoke2is affixed to its respective hub flange16aor16bat its first end4and extend to attach the rim8at its second ends6. The tire10is fitted to the outer periphery of the rim8. The wheel ofFIG.1is generic and may be of tension-spoke or compression-spoke design.", "", "The axial direction92is any direction parallel with the axial axis28. The radial direction93is a direction generally perpendicular to the axial direction92and extending generally from the axial axis28radially outwardly toward the rim8. The tangential direction94is a direction generally tangent to the rim at a given radius. The circumferential direction95is a cylindrical vector that wraps around the axial axis28at a given radius. A radial plane96is a plane perpendicular to the axial axis28that extends in a generally radial direction at a given axial intercept. An axial plane97is a plane that extends along the axial axis28. An orientation that is radially inboard (or inward) is nearer to the axial axis28of rotation and a radially outboard (or outward) is further from the axial axis28. An axially inboard (or inward) orientation is an orientation that is axially proximal to the axial midpoint between the two end faces11aand11b. Conversely, an axially outboard (or outward) orientation is an orientation that is axially distal to the axial midpoint between the two end faces11aand11b. A radially inboard orientation is an orientation that is radially proximal to the axial axis28and a radially outboard orientation is an orientation that is radially distal to the axial axis28. An axially inwardly facing surface is a surface that faces toward the axial midpoint between the two end faces11aand11b. Conversely, an axially outwardly facing surface is a surface that faces away from the axial midpoint between the two end faces11aand11b.", "", "The axial axis28is the central axis of rotation of the wheel. A radial axis29is an axis extending perpendicular to and intersecting with the axial axis28. A tangential axis31is an axis in the radial plane96that is perpendicular to the radial axis29and radially offset from the axial axis28.", "", "While it is most common for the hub shell14to rotate about a fixed axle9, there are some cases where it is desirable to permit the axle9to be fixed with the wheel1such as the case where the wheel1is driven by the axle9.", "", "For the purposes of using conventional terminology, the term \u201chub flange\u201d is used herein to describe a region of the hub shell14to which the spokes2are joined. While the surface of the hub flange may be raised and flange-like in comparison to other surfaces of the hub shell14, this is not a requirement for the present invention and the hub flange16may alternatively be flush or recessed relative to other hub shell surfaces.", "", "As is well known in the art, a wheel1may be of tension-spoke construction, where the central hub hangs in tension by the spokes from the rim portion directly above, or it may be of compression-spoke construction, where the hub is supported by compressing the spoke directly beneath it. Since the present invention may be directed toward bicycle wheels and since the tension-spoke wheel is generally a more efficient structure than compression-spoke wheel, most of the discussion herein is focused with an eye toward tension-spoke wheel construction. However, it is anticipated that most, if not all, of the embodiments of the present invention may be adapted or otherwise applied to compression-spoke wheel construction as well. For a tension-spoke wheel, it is preferable that the wheel includes at least two hub flanges that are axially spaced on either side of the rim or, more specifically, the spoke attachment points at the rim. Thus, the spokes fixed to opposite hub flanges will converge as they extend to the rim as illustrated inFIG.2b. Additionally, a tension-spoke wheel will usually be pre-tensioned during assembly to create a pre-tensioned structure of balanced spoke tension that allows the axle supporting loads to be distributed among several, if not all, of the spokes of the wheel. It is this ability to share the stresses among its spokes that helps to make the tension-spoke wheel the highly efficient structure that it is. For a compression-spoke wheel, it is often preferable to employ at least two axially spaced hub flanges, however, in the case where the spokes have sufficient bending stiffness to support the requisite lateral or side-to-side loads, only a single hub flange may be employed.", "", "The spoke2is a generally long slender tensile element with a longitudinal axis62along its length and generally parallel to its sidewalls. The spoke2also has a tensile axis61of applied tensile load58that extends along the span portion of the spoke2between its anchor points at the rim8and hub flange16. The tensile axis61is generally collinear to the longitudinal axis62, except where the spoke2is bent to deviate from the tensile axis61. For the purposes of definition, as relating to spokes2and connections thereto, the term \u201clongitudinal\u201d herein refers to alignment along the longitudinal axis62. A longitudinally inboard (or inward) orientation refers to an orientation proximal the midpoint of the span portion. Conversely, a longitudinally outboard (or outward) orientation refers to an orientation distal the midpoint of the span portion. The term \u201clateral\u201d herein refers to an orientation in a direction generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis62. A laterally inboard (or inward) orientation refers to an orientation proximal the longitudinal axis. Conversely, a laterally outboard (or outward) orientation refers to an orientation distal the longitudinal axis62.", "", "FIGS.2a,2band2cdescribe the current technology in conventional bicycle wheels that most cyclists are familiar with. This prior art design includes a rim8, a hub shell14and a plurality of spokes3. The hub shell14is rotatable about the axle9and includes a pair of axially spaced hub flanges16aand16b. The wheel is assembled by first threading each individual spoke3through an axial hole17in the hub flange16until the j-bend19of the first end4is hooked within the hole17. The spoke3is then pivoted to extend in a generally radial direction toward the rim8. The enlarged portion34or \u201chead\u201d of the spoke3prevents the spoke3from pulling through the hole17in the hub flange16a. The second end6of each spoke3is then fixed to the rim8via spoke nipples21. The span of the spoke3is defined herein as the portion of the spoke3that spans between its connection to the hub flange (16aor16b) at its first end4and its connection to the rim8at its second end6and the span length refers to the longitudinal length of the span. Tightening the threaded engagement between the spoke nipple21and the spoke3serves to effectively shorten the span length of the spoke3. Thus, as the nipples21are threadably tightened, the spokes3are drawn up tight and a degree of pre-tension is induced in each spoke3. By selectively adjusting this threaded engagement, the spoke pre-tension may be adjusted and balanced relative to the other spokes3and to also align the trueness and roundness of the rim8. The spoke pre-tension is resisted by circumferential compression of the rim8and it is this balance of forces that imparts efficient structural integrity to the bicycle wheel1. Also shown inFIG.2b, there is lateral bracing angle38between the radial centerline plane of the rim8and the centerline62of the spoke3. As this bracing angle38is increased, the lateral or side-to-side stiffness (i.e. stiffness in the axial direction92) of the wheel1is also increased. As shown inFIG.2a, the spokes are shown with common \u201ccrossed\u201d lacing where the spokes2span to be tangent to their corresponding hub flanges16aand16b. As such, there is a circumferential angle35between the longitudinal axis62and the radial axis29.", "", "It is noted that the threadable connection between the nipple21and its mating spoke3serves both as a pre-tensioning means and as a means to lock the second end6of the spoke3to the rim8during use of the bicycle wheel. This pre-tensioning means occurs within the spoke itself since the engagement interface (i.e. the threadable engagement) serves to both induce the pre-tension in the spoke and to maintain this pre-tension during operation of the wheel1. This requires that this threadable connection be robust enough to perform both of these functions and that the threadable engagement must operate smoothly and consistently. As such, both the spoke3and the nipple21are preferably metallic materials with sufficient strength and hardness to achieve a smooth and consistent threadable adjustment as well as having a high degree of structural strength of the threadable engagement. However, these metallic materials are generally heavy in comparison with fiber reinforced spoke materials. Further, if one attempts to incorporate such metallic threads with a fiber reinforced spoke, this is difficult to achieve and adds complexity and cost to the fiber reinforced spoke while also increasing weight.", "", "It is further noted that in a tension spoke wheel1, the pre-tension of the spokes3induce a longitudinal tensile strain and stretch in the corresponding spokes, as well as a circumferential hoop compression strain of the rim8. There may also be a strain of the hub assembly14, however such strains are commonly quite small in comparison to strain of the spoke3and/or rim8. In order for the wheel1to effectively support cycling loads, it is important to carefully balance this spoke pre-tension so that the cycling loads are evenly distributed throughout the wheel1and so that the wheel rim8rotates round and true. It is usually preferable that these strains be within the elastic limit of the corresponding spoke3and/or rim8. This is commonly achieved by adjusting the length of the spoke span to induce strain in the wheel and then locking the spoke connections at its first end4and second end6to fix the length of the spoke span therebetween and maintain the pre-tension in the spokes3while the wheel1is in its free-state (i.e. prior to loading the wheel in use).", "", "FIGS.3a-fdescribe an exemplary rim20of generally conventional geometry. As detailed inFIGS.3aand3b, rim20is of a generally hollow construction, commonly termed \u201cdouble-wall\u201d construction, and includes a radially inboard spoke bed22wall of thickness23and a radially outboard tire bed24wall and generally radially extending sidewalls26aand26bto define a generally hollow circumferential cavity27. Spoke bed22is defined by a radially inboard surface32and a radially outboard surface33. Hooked flanges30aand30bare adapted to engage the beads of a conventional tire (not shown).", "", "The spoke bed22is pierced with a plurality of spoke holes36adapted for connection with their respective spokes2via spoke nipples48. It may be seen that the spoke hole36has a radially inboard edge39at its intersection with the inboard surface32and a radially outboard edge40at its intersection with the radially outboard surface34. Further, outboard edge40may be seen to have axially spaced quadrant points42aand42bas well as circumferentially spaced quadrant points44aand44b. The tire bed24is pierced by access hole37that is aligned with spoke hole36, to permit the nipple48to be assembled as shown inFIGS.3aand3c. Note that access hole37is merely one common means to permit the nipple48to be assembled to the rim; a wide range of alternative means may be substituted, including means that do not require an access hole.", "", "It is useful to understand that it is common to manufacture the rim20by extruding the straight profile shown here and rolling the extrusion into a circumferential hoop with its ends joined by either a welded, sleeved or pinned connection. Spoke holes36and access holes37are then drilled in their proper locations.", "", "FIG.3ashows an exploded view that describes the conventional arrangement by which the second end6of the spoke2is connected to the rim20. The second end6of spoke2includes external threads46to mate with internal threads47of spoke nipple48. Spoke nipple48includes an enlarged head50and a shank52, with a generally conical tapered transition portion54extending between the underside of the head50and the shank52. Spoke nipple48also includes flats56for engagement with a mating wrench (not shown) for manual manipulation to adjust the spoke pre-tension by adjusting the threaded engagement between external threads46and internal threads47. Nipple48is considered an \u201cexternal\u201d spoke nipple, since it has a shank52that extends through the spoke hole36so that its flats56are exposed and may be manipulated externally to the rim20. A \u201cnipple\u201d or \u201cspoke nipple\u201d is defined herein as an element that is connected to the spoke and that includes a bearing surface for overlie engagement with the rim. Most commonly, the nipple is connected to the spoke by a threadable engagement. An \u201cexternal nipple\u201d, such as spoke nipple48, is defined herein as a spoke nipple that extends to a point longitudinally inwardly of the inboard surface of the spoke bed.FIGS.3c-fshows the spoke nipple48threadably assembled to the spoke2such that the transition portion54overlies and contacts the outboard edge40. The transition portion54serves as a bearing surface or engagement surface of the spoke2for bearing interface with the rim20to support spoke tension58forces. The spoke nipple48is thereby braced against the spoke bed22to resist the spoke tension58of the spoke2.", "", "It may be seen that the outboard surface34of the spoke bed22is of generally concave geometry as viewed in the cross-sectional views ofFIGS.3d-f. Thus, the intersection between the cylindrical spoke hole36and the concave outboard surface34creates a saddle-shaped outboard edge40, such that quadrant points42aand42bare spaced by radial distance60to be radially outboard of quadrant points44aand44b. With spoke nipple48aligned with angle of inclination18bas shown, it may be seen that the transition portion54contacts the outboard surface34of the spoke bed22only at the quadrant point42a, which is offset from the longitudinal axis62by distance64. Shank52also contacts inboard edge38, which restrains axial movement of the nipple48and forces the transition portion54against quadrant point42a. With the transition portion54supported only by quadrant portion42a, it may be seen that the transition portion54does not contact, and is spaced from, the outboard edge40at quadrant points42b,44aand44b.", "", "Since the spoke tension58acts along the longitudinal axis62, the offset distance64(between the longitudinal axis62and contacting quadrant point42a) tends to induce a bending moment to rotate the spoke nipple48in the direction66toward a reduced angle of inclination18bthat is no longer in alignment with the spoke centerline62or longitudinal axis62. Further, the spoke tension58tends to induce the conical transition portion54to ramp against its contact point at quadrant point42a. This, in combination with the contact between the inboard edge39and shank52at contact point45further induces the nipple48to pivot in the direction66. The result is that the spoke2tends to bend in response to the aforementioned moment, thus creating a bent region68(FIG.3f) just inboard of the spoke nipple48and thereby inducing a bending stress in the spoke2. As with all tension-spoke wheels, as the loaded wheel1is rotated along the ground, each successive spoke undergoes a cycle of reduced and increased spoke tension58. This causes the bent region68to flex with each revolution of the wheel, creating a much higher potential for fatigue failure of the spoke2as compared to a spoke without a bent region68and its associated bending stress. Further, the bending and associated flex described here tends to reduce the effective tensile stiffness of the spoke2between its attachment points, thereby reducing the overall structural stiffness of the wheel1.", "", "Additionally, since the majority of the spoke tension58is braced and resisted by the overlie engagement between the nipple48and only the single contact point at quadrant point42a, the contact load due to spoke tension58induces a very highly concentrated contact stress at this singular contact point. This high contact stress may result in localized galling as the nipple48is rotatably manipulated with in its spoke hole36. Furthermore, this high contact stress may cause excessive stress and deformation of the nipple48and/or spoke hole36. This very high localized stress also commonly causes cracking and failure of the rim due to fatigue. To resist the stress and minimize such failure, the spoke bed22needs to be very thick, which adds weight to the rim, detracting from the performance of the wheel.", "", "It is noted that the concentrated single contact point at quadrant point42ais also coincident with the edge of the spoke hole36. Thus, not only does the existence of spoke hole36create a stress riser in the spoke bed22, but the region of highest contact stress occurs right on the edge of this spoke hole to amplify this stress riser. As a result, due to high usage and fatigue loading, it is very common for cracks to form in the spoke bed22that radiate out from the spoke hole.", "", "It is noted that some have attempted to mitigate this elevated stress by drilling the spoke holes36at an angle from the radial axis29that is intended to correspond to the longitudinal axis62in a procedure known as \u201cangled spoke drilling\u201d. However, this angled spoke drilling does not appreciably increase the contact area of engagement between the transition surface54and the outboard edge40. Correspondingly, the contact stress at this interface remains very high. It would therefore be beneficial to mitigate these fatigue cracks is to modify the conventional design to distribute the spoke contact loads over a larger area of the rim to reduce the contact stress.", "", "FIGS.4a-cdescribe another exemplary rim70of conventional geometry. Rim70is generally identical to rim20, however the outboard surface72of spoke bed74instead has a generally flat contour defining a generally flat cylindrical surface. This means that outboard edge78of spoke hole76is a flat circular edge. However, due to the angle of inclination18bof the spoke2and spoke nipple48, the transition portion54contacts the outboard edge78at only a single contact point80, which is offset from the longitudinal axis62by offset distance82. The angle of inclination18bmay also be considered to be an axial skew angle of the longitudinal axis62relative to the radial axis29. Like the prior art embodiment ofFIGS.3a-f, this offset distance82induces a bending moment in the spoke2, including the associated bending and flex previously described herein.", "", "Thus, it may be seen that it is advantageous to reduce or eliminate the offset distance64or82to minimize the bending or flex associated with the prior-art arrangements described inFIGS.3a-fandFIGS.4a-b. The following embodiments of the present invention describe a variety of methods to reduce or eliminate this offset distance.", "", "As illustrated inFIG.2a, spokes are commonly laced such that their longitudinal axis36is radially offset from the axial axis28such that the spokes cross past each other. This well understood in industry and where the term \u201ccross\u201d is commonly used to describe how many spokes an individual spoke crosses within its span. This radial offset means that the spoke is commonly circumferentially skewed from a radial axis29at its intersection with the rim. This is particularly illustrated inFIG.4c, where longitudinal axis62(also considered the \u201clongitudinal axis\u201d) of spoke2is skewed from the radial axis29by a circumferential clockwise skew angle73and longitudinal axis62\u2032 (also considered the \u201clongitudinal axis\u201d) of spoke2\u2032 is skewed from the radial axis29by a circumferential counterclockwise skew angle73\u2032.", "", "In contrast toFIGS.4a-c, which show the nipple48as extending through the spoke hole76to extend inboard of the spoke bed74,FIGS.5a-cdescribe an arrangement that utilizes a nipple84that is entirely radially outboard of the spoke bed89. Rim86is similar to rim70, with the exception that its spoke hole90is sized to provide clearance for only the spoke83. The rim86includes a spoke bed88with a radially outwardly facing outboard surface89. Spoke83is similar to spoke2and is of conventional configuration, including longitudinal axis85and external threads. The nipple84includes an engagement face91to bear against the outboard surface89of spoke bed88and internal threads (obscured).

Most commonly, an internal nipple extends longitudinally outboard of the engagement surface or bearing surface of the nipple.FIG.5ashows the nipple84prior to its threadable assembly with the spoke83.", "", "FIG.5bshows the nipple84as next threadably assembled to the spoke83in the conventional manner until its engagement face91first contacts the outboard surface89as shown inFIG.5b. Due to the bracing angle99of the spoke83, the engagement face91does not mate squarely with the outboard face89, but instead is tilted or canted by angle87. Further threadable tightening of the nipple84, and the resulting spoke tension, causes the nipple84to rotate in direction98so that engagement face91bears squarely against the outboard surface89as shown inFIG.5c. However, this rotation results in a kink or bend93in the spoke83, resulting in increased stress and misalignment of the spoke83, as also described inFIG.3f. These figures illustrate the particular problems associated with the use of internal nipples with conventional rims.", "", "It is an object of the present invention to increase the contact area and improve the alignment between the transition portion54and the spoke hole76and/or between the engagement face91and the outboard surface89. This will serve to reduce the contact stress therebetween and result in increased fatigue resistance of the rim and spoke and also greater overall stiffness of the wheel1. This may be achieved by modifying the spoke bed74such that the outboard edge78and/or the portion of the outboard surface72surrounding the spoke hole76is more closely matched to the transition portion54. For the purposes of definition herein, the outboard edge78and/or the portion of the outboard surface72that provides blocking contact with a mating surface of the spoke, such as the transition surface54, is termed the \u201cbearing surface\u201d, since this is the surface and/or edge that bears against the spoke nipple48to provide connection between the spoke2and the rim70.", "", "One method for such modification of the spoke bed74is to remove material of the spoke bed74such that the outboard edge78and/or the portion of the outboard surface72surrounding the spoke hole76is more closely matched to the transition portion54.

That is to say, a distance between the brake member421and the caster subunit22in the up-down direction (D11) is adjustable. Because the brake member421brakes the caster subunit22via friction when abutting against the cast subunit22, abrasion of the brake wall sections426is inevitable when the caster device has been used for a long time. Moreover, because the moving rod41may only be urged by the cam member52to move in the up-down direction (D11) within a certain range, the abrasion of the brake wall sections426may affect braking effectiveness of the embodiment.
