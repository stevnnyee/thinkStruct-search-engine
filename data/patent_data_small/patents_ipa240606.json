In order to enable secure and easy fastening of the disc cover, the fastening device comprises several fastening holes arranged in the hub connection flange, with at least one fastening hole consisting of a through hole having a smaller diameter on the front side of the wheel than on a rear side of the hub connection flange and forming an abutment for a detachable retaining means acting by form fit, and/or wherein at least one fastening hole consists of a through hole provided with an internal thread for screwing in a fastening screw as a retaining means, and/or that the centre hole has an inner circle edge comprising a constriction which forms an abutment for a cover side arranged retaining means acting by form fit.", "detailed_description": ["FIG.1shows a vehicle wheel10according to the invention for a commercial vehicle together with a mounted wheel disc cover, designated altogether by reference numeral50, according to a first exemplary embodiment. The vehicle wheel10consists, in a manner known per se, of a metal rim1which is adapted in terms of size, dimensions, shape and thickness for mounting on the hub of an axle, in particular the (front) drive axle of a commercial vehicle, not shown. The ring-shaped closed rim1accordingly has an inner rim flange2, an inner rim shoulder3, a rim well base4, a transition section5, an outer rim shoulder6and an outer rim flange7. In the design of the vehicle wheel10or the rim1for a commercial vehicle, both rim shoulders3,6are designed as steep shoulders with a 15\u00b0 (15\u00b0-degree) angle relative to the wheel axle.", "", "In the interior of the rim1is arranged a wheel disc, designated overall by reference numeral20, which has, in the exemplary embodiment shown, in a manner known per se, a hub connection flange21formed concentrically around the wheel axle, which is provided with several, for example 4, 5 or 10, bolt holes22arranged on a bolt circle for the passage of wheel bolts, not shown, and forms the contact surface and abutment surface on the vehicle-side hub with its rear side23. The hub connection flange21merges radially outwards into a transition region24which is provided with several ventilation holes25and then ends in a disc edge26via which the wheel disc20is connected to the rim, preferably by means of a welded connection. The hub connection flange21itself has a centre hole27with an inner circle edge28. Such a design of a preferably metal, multi-part vehicle wheel is known to the person skilled in the art, which is why the possible variants for the design of the disc shape and the rim shape are not discussed here further. The vehicle wheel could also be designed in one piece and consist of aluminium, for example.", "", "In the exemplary embodiment shown, the hub connection flange21protrudes axially over the plane spanned by the circumferential outer rim flange7. The designations inner rim flange2and outer rim flange7refer to the mounting state of such a vehicle wheel on a vehicle, because then the outer rim flange7is on the outside, whereas the inner rim flange2disappears inside in the wheel housing or the like. The normally visible wheel outside of the vehicle wheel1is therefore essentially formed by the front side29of the hub connection flange21, the transition area24, the inside of the outer rim shoulder6and the inside of the outer rim flange7. Referring to the annular rim, inside designates the radial inner side, whereas a tyre, not shown, is mounted on the radial outer side of the rim.", "", "The outer side of the vehicle wheel10is almost completely covered by the aerodynamic ring-shaped wheel disc cover50. The wheel disc cover50essentially extends from the centre hole27to the outer rim flange7. In the exemplary embodiment according toFIG.1, the wheel disc cover50is in several parts; it has a cover main body51, which is preferably made of a suitable plastic, has a substantially ring-shaped basic shape and is inherently rigid. Here, the cover main body51has an end face53running conically from the outer circumference52radially inwards and axially outwards, and a bottom face55which together enclose a cavity60. On the outer circumference52, a web56extends, which is preferably integrally or form-fit formed on the cover main body51and which, as can be seen particularly clearly from the lower half ofFIG.1, is provided with a plurality of air guide slots57, via which air can enter the intermediate space between the bottom side55of the cover and the front side of the wheel disc20, in order, for example, to ensure adequate cooling of the brakes during ongoing driving operation. Both the closed end face53and the air guide slots57on the web56decisively influence the aerodynamics and to this extent also the air resistance on the vehicle wheel10when it is mounted on a vehicle. Different designs of aerodynamic covers can be used for the present invention, as the invention essentially relates to the manner in which the wheel disc cover50is fastened to the vehicle wheel1.", "", "In the exemplary embodiment ofFIG.1as well asFIG.2andFIG.3, to which reference is now additionally made, a special modification has been made for fastening the wheel disc cover50to the wheel disc20in that the wheel disc20has a plurality of fastening holes30arranged on a bolt circle around the wheel axle, of which, however, only a single fastening hole30is shown. The fastening hole30is provided with an internal thread, and a fastening screw40interacts with the fastening hole30as retaining means. The fastening holes30are arranged on a bolt circle that is similar to the bolt circle of the bolt holes22, but the fastening holes30have a much smaller diameter, asFIGS.1to3clearly show. The cover main body51has blind hole depressions58with a through hole59in the bottom side55for the arrangement of the fastening screws40, and the blind hole depressions58have a cylindrical peripheral wall, which delimits the cavity60of the cover main body51. The several blind hole depressions58distributed on a bolt circle correspond in their number and position to the number and position of the fastening holes30in the hub connection flange21. Due to the depth of the blind hole depressions58, the head41of the fastening screw40does not act directly against the bottom of the blind hole depressions58, but is used between sleeves42, via which the length of the fastening screw40can be adapted to the depth of the blind hole depressions58. The design must be such that the screw40can be screwed into the threaded fastening hole30with a sufficient tightening torque without the threaded shank of the fastening screw40protruding at the rear side of the hub connection flange21.", "", "So that the blind hole depressions58do not impair the aerodynamics of the wheel disc cover50, the individual blind hole depressions58are arranged in a region of the main body51which is recessed with respect to the end face53. This resulting depression61can in turn be covered by a cover ring65, which in the exemplary embodiment shown is additionally provided on its underside66with a circular cam67for each blind hole depression58, which is designed and adapted to dip into the blind hole depressions58in the mounted state, as can be seen particularly well inFIG.3. A retaining force for the cover ring65can be generated by means of a suitable clearance or transition fit between the outer circumference of the cam67and the inner circumference of the blind hole depressions58. For additional locking of the cover ring65on the main body51, the cover ring65is provided with a sloping, reversibly bendable retaining lip68on the inside, which has an offset69at its lower end in order to engage behind a correspondingly positioned and formed wedge surface on the radial inner circumference of the main body51, as can be seen particularly well fromFIG.3.", "", "The fastening device formed by means of the fastening screws40and the threaded fastening holes30does not form the only locking means for the aerodynamic cover50, because a second locking also takes place on the inside of the outer rim flange7. The main body51of the wheel disc cover50is correspondingly provided with an additional locking device on the outer circumference52, which has either a single, circumferential locking element70which engages the arcuately curved inner side of the outer rim flange7with a form fit body formed for example by a bead or a curvature, in order to effect locking of the cover50on the vehicle wheel in the region of the outer circumference of the cover50by form fit. However, this additional locking element does not have to be formed circumferentially, but it could also consist of several individual pieces or a plurality of individual elements directly adjoining one another. However, it is preferably a locking element that is integrally formed on the cover. The additional support and locking on the outer rim flange7also ensures very good centring of the wheel disc cover50on the vehicle wheel numeral ten.", "", "FIGS.4to7show a second design of a vehicle wheel110with a correspondingly installed wheel disc cover150. Functionally identical components to the previous exemplary embodiment are denoted by reference symbols increased by 100. Here, too, the outside of the vehicle wheel110is formed by the front side129of the hub connection flange121, the transition section124with the ventilation holes125, the inside of the outer rim shoulder106and the inside of the outer rim flange107. The wheel disc cover150has essentially the same basic shape as the wheel disc cover in the previous exemplary embodiment, with an end face153that runs conically inwards and axially forwards and an outer circumference152on which a circumferential annular web156with air guide slots (not shown) is arranged. InFIG.4, the outer locking means in the form of the locking element170can be seen particularly well, wherein, in the exemplary embodiment according toFIG.4, the locking element170is additionally provided on its end face, lying axially inwards from and offset to the web156, with a separate and replaceable bead ring175, with which the locking element170engages with form fit in the locking lip formed by the inside of the outer rim flange107.", "", "Unlike the previous embodiment, the hub connection flange121is provided with several mounting holes130here that do not have a thread but have a smaller inner diameter at the front side129than at the rear side123of the hub connection flange121. In the exemplary embodiment according toFIGS.4-7, each fastening hole130arranged on a bolt circle around the wheel axle is provided with a step136, as can be seen particularly well inFIG.6. The dimensions of the fastening hole130are indicated inFIG.7. The fastening hole has a smaller inside diameter DI1 in front of step136and a larger inside diameter DI2 behind step136. The difference between DI1 and DI2 is preferably at least 0.8 mm, and in particular more than 1.9 mm. The undercut formed by the step136has only a small depth T1 with respect to the front side129, whereas the section with the diameter DI2 has a significantly greater depth T2. The ratio of T1/T2 can be, for example, between 1/1 and 1/5, and is preferably between 1/2 and 1/3. The depth is at least 1.5 mm.", "", "For the locking the wheel disc cover150to the stepped fastening holes130, the main body151is provided with integrally formed latch pins180extending rearwardly beyond the bottom face155, as can be readily seen fromFIGS.5to7. Each locking pin180is formed in two parts and has a first flexible partial element181and a second flexible partial element182which can be pushed into one another or apart from one another. The partial elements181,182of the two parts locking pin180are pre-stressed or pre-curved in such a way that they are normally pushed together slightly inward. The locking pin at180or the partial elements181,102are provided with a centre hole183, into which a preferably metal pin185can be inserted as an actuating element and securing element in the exemplary embodiment shown. If the pin185is inserted in the centre hole183, as shown inFIGS.5and7for example, the two partial elements181,182cannot be pushed together, but rather they engage in a form-fitting manner with their hook projections186on the end faces of the partial elements181,182of the locking pin180on the step136of the fastening hole130. However, if the pin185is removed, the partial elements181,182can move inward and the wheel disc cover150can be demounted.", "", "Here, too, blind hole depressions158are formed in a depressed section161of the main body151, at the front of which the locking pins180are formed integrally. The blind hole depressions158serve to receive retaining cams167on the underside of a cover ring165in a recessed manner, with which the receding recessed section161can be covered and filled flush with the end face153of the main body151in order to optimize the aerodynamics. The number of cams167with pins185held on the cover ring165by means of these is preferably adapted to the number of stepped fastening holes130in the hub connection flange121. By mounting the cover ring165, all pins185are inserted into the locking projections180, and locking and securing of all retaining means is effected via the cover ring165. In order that this is additionally anchored to the main body151, in the exemplary embodiment according toFIG.5toFIG.7, the cover ring165has a flexible retaining lip with an offset169in order to engage behind a correspondingly formed mating surface on the cover main body151.", "", "FIG.8shows, in a very simplified schematic form, a third embodiment variant for retaining means for a cover250. On the hub connection flange221, only indicated, several fastening holes230are distributed on a bolt circle around the wheel axle, wherein each fastening hole widens conically from the front side229to the back side223of the hub connection flange221. The ratio of the minimum diameter DA on the front side229to the maximum diameter DB on the rear side223can be 0.5<DA/DB<0.85, for example, whereby the conical course forms a sufficient retention surface for retaining means engaging the conical through-holes. The retaining means could hereby be designed in exactly the same way as in the previous exemplary embodiment with corresponding multi-part locking pins, wherein the conical surface would have the advantage during disassembly that the part elements are automatically pushed together. Alternatively, a wheel disc cover250could also be anchored to the fastening hole230by means of an expansion dowel291and a plug-in rivet290, which pass through a suitable through hole in the cover250, as indicated schematically inFIG.8.", "", "FIGS.9and10show a fourth embodiment variant of a vehicle wheel310and a cover350; this embodiment variant also has two locking surfaces or locking means that are spaced apart from one another, namely, on the one hand, a locking element370on the outer circumference352of the cover350, which interacts with the inside of the outer rim flange307, and also a further retaining means, which is integrally formed on the cover350and interacts with a constriction395on the inner circle edge329of the centre hole327on the hub connection flange321. The constriction395on the rear side323of the hub connection flange321is formed by means of a taper, which provides a clearance or undercut at the rear side323of the hub connection flange321, as illustrated by the dimensions inFIG.10. With respect to the total thickness of the wheel disc in the region of the hub connection flange321, the beginning of the taper may have a distance TA from the front side329of the hub connection flange321that is preferably approximately equal to or only slightly greater than half the total thickness of the hub connection flange. The internal offset TB of the taper is preferably smaller than the distance TA, whereas the total length TC of the taper is longer than the distance TA. By appropriately dimensioning the taper or constriction395, the wheel disc cover350can be provided as the first inner locking means or retaining means of a fastening device with a flexible but sufficiently rigid retaining lip396, which is provided with a hook projection397on the end face. The length of the retaining lip396is selected such that the retaining lip396protrudes rearward beyond the bottom side355of the wheel disc cover main body351. The length is altogether dimensioned in such a way that the hook projection397dips into the constriction395when the wheel disc cover350is mounted on the vehicle wheel310, but without hitting the front side of the hub. As the retaining lip is also ring-shaped here, the wheel disc cover350is additionally locked in a concentric, circumferential manner at the centre hole327of the vehicle wheel310.", "", "There is also an alternative in the fourth variant, in which the constriction is not designed by means of a taper at the transition from the inner circumference of the centre hole to the rear side of the hub connection flange of the wheel disc, but by means of a circumferential groove directly in the inner circumference of the centre hole. The retaining lip on the cover350would then have a somewhat shorter length so that a correspondingly designed hook projection can engage in the groove.", "", "Numerous modifications will become apparent to the person skilled in the art from the foregoing description, which are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. It is clear to the person skilled in the art that individual retaining means could be combined with one another in order to increase the secure locking of the aerodynamic wheel disc cover. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the offset of the wheel disc in the rim ensures that the hub connection flange clearly projects over the outer rim flange of the rim. In other designs of vehicle wheels, the hub connection flange could also lie inside the wheel, thus projecting less far than the outer rim flange when viewed axially. In such an embodiment, the wheel disc cover could then be designed flat overall and without a cone, or with an inverted cone, so that air guide slots for cooling the brakes can still be provided axially outside the outer rim flange. The air guide slots are preferably formed by such flow guide bodies which at the same time reduce the turbulence during the rotation of the vehicle wheel.", "", "The invention has been described with reference to metal vehicle wheels.
