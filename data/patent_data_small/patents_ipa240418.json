When mated with a rim, the non-pneumatic tire body therefore contacts the rim over a full, or substantially full, width thereof.", "", "As best shown inFIG.4, the central span22of each cleat body16resides a short distance inwardly from the outer circumference of the tire body in a tangentially oriented plane thereof, and the two side walls18,20of each cleat body16project outwardly through the outer circumference26of the tire body such that each side wall18,20defines a respective cleat30reaching radially outward from the tire body to a terminal end32of the cleat30that will therefore contact the ground during rotation of the tire. Each cleat body16is moulded into the respective segment14of the tire body during manufacture thereof, as described in more detail below, whereby each cleat30is retained in place solely by the embedded state of the respective cleat body16within the tire body, without the use of any additional cleat fasteners or cleat retention means. The central span22of each cleat body16features a series of openings34therein at spaced apart intervals in the axial direction of the tire. The tire body material spans radially across the central span22of the cleat body16through these openings34in order to more firmly secure the cleat body in place.", "", "The tire body16has two opposing sides36,38spaced apart in the axial direction thereof. A length of each cleat body16measured axially of the tire body12is slightly less than a width of the tire measured in the same axial direction between the two sides36,38of the tire body16. The cleat bodies16are centered between the two sides of the tire body, whereby each end of the cleat body terminates a short distance axially inward from the respective side of the tire body. This way, neither end of the cleat body is exposed at the respective side of the tire body, thereby improving the cleat's resistance to delamination, loosening or separation from the tire body. The central span22of each cleat body spans and defines the full length of the overall cleat body while each side wall18,20projecting outward form the outer circumference26of the tire body to define the respective cleat30has a shorter axial length than the central span22. The two cleats30of each cleat body16start at opposing ends of the cleat body16, whereby one of the two cleats resides nearer to one side of the tire body and the other cleat resides nearer to the other side of the tire body. Moving around the outer circumference26of the tire body, each cleat body16lies in an axially-reversed orientation relative to the next cleat body16. As a result, the cleats are arranged in staggered pattern in which sequentially adjacent cleats around the outer circumference of the tire body alternate between a first position adjacent the first side of the tire body and a second position adjacent the second side of the tire body. The staggering of the cleats balances the desire for cleats of notable axial length to ensure confident contact of the cleats with the ground over which the tire is travelling regardless of irregularities or variations therein, while leaving more space between cleats at the sides of the tire to better allow mud and debris to fall free of the tire instead of becoming firmly packed between tightly spaced cleats.", "", "The side walls18,20of each cleat body are planar or plate-like in form, whereby each cleat30lies axially of the tire body in a respective radial plane. Each cleat30, in a cross-sectional plane thereof cutting perpendicularly through the planar cleat in a tangential direction of the tire body therefore has a length LCor axial dimension that exceeds its thickness TCor tangential dimension. The length dimension LCof each cleat is more than half of the tire width WT, and in one embodiment less than \u00be of the tire width WT, for example measuring approximately \u2154 thereof. Since each cleat body is shorter than the tire width WT, and each cleat is shorter than the overall cleat body length (as defined by the central span22thereof), the two cleats30of each cleat body16thus overlap one another in the axial direction of the tire. Each cleat30reaches past a vertical mid-plane, which herein refers to a reference plane that cuts through the tire halfway between the sides36,38thereof and lies perpendicular to the central rotational axis24. The angular distance between any two sequentially adjacent cleat bodies16in the circumferential direction around the central rotational axis24is equal to the circumferentially angular distance between the two cleats of each cleat body16so that all the cleats are equally spaced around the tire.", "", "Each tire body segment14spans a respective partial circumferential distance around the central rotational axis24so that a convex outer surface40of each segment defines a respective span of the overall tire body's outer circumference26, while a convex inner surface42of each segment likewise defines a respective span of the overall tire body's inner circumference. Opposing first and second sides44,46of each segment face opposing directions around the central rotational axis24of the tire, and each lie in a respective radial plane thereof. The first side44of one segment thus mates in flush contact with the second side46of a sequentially adjacent segment around the circumference of the assembled tire body. Each cleat body16is circumferentially centered in the respective tire body segment14, whereby the mated-together sides of two adjacent or neighboring segments are located centrally between the two respective cleat bodies in the circumferential direction of the tire.", "", "With reference toFIGS.6A and6B, the two mating sides44,46of the neighboring segments, and thus the two opposing sides of each individual segment, have matable male and female profiles. That is, one side44of each segment has a female recessed area44atherein, while the opposing side46has a male protruding area46athereon that is sized and shaped to mate with the recessed area of the adjacent segment in the assembled tire. In the illustrated embodiments, each recessed area44aand protruding area46ahas a simple rectangular shape spanning the full radial dimension of the respective side of the segment between the inner and outer surfaces42,40thereof. Each recessed area44aand protruding area46ais centered in the axial direction of the respective segment14so that the male and female areas44a,46amate together at the mid-plane of the tire and block axial separation of adjacent segments from one another in both axial directions moving outward from said mid-plane.", "", "Each segment14has a plurality of hollow cavities therein, of which there are three in the illustrated embodiments. These three cavities52,54,56lie axially of the segment14and terminate at the opposing ends of the segment (i.e. at the opposing sides36,38of the tire body12). In the illustrated embodiments, each cavity52,54,56is open at both sides of the tire body, but is closed at the mid-plane of the tire body by an intact internal wall58of each tire body segment14that, if omitted, would result each cavity passing fully and continuously through the tire body in the axial direction, which may be true of other embodiments. Accordingly, the three cavities of each segment may be interpreted as three cavities, each of which is divided into two parallel sub-cavities situated axially end-to-end with one another and closed off from one another by the intact internal wall58of the segment, or may be interpreted as six total cavities, three on each side of the tire's mid-plane in alignment with the three cavities on the other side of the tire's mid-plane. The cavities, being void of the rubber material of the tire body segments, increase the radial compressibility of the segments compared to a solid rubber segment that lacks any such voids between the inner and outer circumference of the tire. While the illustrated embodiments feature material-void cavities that contain only air and lack any filler material therein, it will be appreciated that cavities containing a filler material of greater radial compressibility than the rubber of the tire segment14would still nonetheless increase the overall compressibility of the segment relative to a solid segment of uniform rubber composition. Accordingly, the term cavity is not intended to specifically, the absence of any material, but rather to denote the absence of the particular material surrounding the cavity, and absence of any material of lesser radial compressibility than said surrounding material. The cross-sectional shape of the cavities in planes normal to the central rotational axis of the tire may vary from those illustrated in the drawings.", "", "The cavities of each tire body segment reside at a radially intermediate region of the segment that is spaced inwardly from each of the inner and outer surfaces28,26thereof and that, more specifically, is situated radially between the respective cleat body16and the inner surface40of the segment. Accordingly, the cleat bodies16reside in a radially outer region of the tire body that is situated between the cavities52,54,56and the outer circumference26of the tire body. Accordingly, as each cleat30comes into contact with the ground during rotation of the tire, the vehicle weight exerted downwardly on the cleat will tend to collapse the cavities52,54,56of the respective tire body segment and compress the respective tire body segment inwardly toward the inner surface40thereof. The central span22of each cleat body16not only contributes to retention of the two respective cleats30to the respective tire body segment, but also distributes the vehicle weight over a greater width of the respective tire body segment14as measured between the two sides44,46of the segment14in the circumferential direction of the tire.", "", "In addition to the embedded state of the cleat bodies16, the tire body12also has mounting elements embedded within the tire body12for use in securing the tire body12to a rim that has a cylindrical outer drum over which the inner circumference28of the tire body12is to be fitted by individual fastening of the tire body segments14to the rim. With reference toFIGS.4,5and8, a respective mounting plate60of elongated rectangular bar-shape lies axially of each segment14in a radially inner region thereof that is situated between the cavity-containing intermediate region and the inner surface40of the segment14. A pair of fastening holes or openings61are provided in each mounting plate60at respective locations near the axially opposing ends60a,60bof the mounting plate60. The threaded studs or shafts62aof a respective pair of threaded fasteners62extend in a radial direction toward and through the inner surface40of the tire body segment14. An enlarged head62bof each fastener62on the outer side of the mounting plate60that faces radially outwardly toward the outer circumference26of the tire prevents the threaded stud62afrom being drawn fully through the respective mounting plate60.", "", "Each fastening hole61of the mounting plate60is square in shape, and each threaded fastener62is a carriage bolt with a square shoulder underlying the head62bof the fastener62. Each square hole61in the mounting plate60is sized to accommodate the square shoulder of the carriage bolt fastener62and constrain the carriage bolt fastener62against rotation. Accordingly, rotation of the fastener62is not only resisted by the rubber of the tire body segment14that envelopes the embedded fastener head62band embedded portion of the fastener stud62a, but also is blocked by the cooperative action between the straight sided mounting plate hole61and the mating shape of the fastener's flat-sided shoulder. Each mounting plate60resides centrally between the male and female profiled sides44,46of the respective tire body segment14in the circumferential direction of the tire body.", "", "The rim features an array of holes passing radially through the outer drum of the rim. These holes in the rim are arranged in pairs so that each pair matches up with the respective two fasteners62of one of the mounting plates60. That is, the two holes of each pair of holes in the rim are axially spaced apart from one another, and circumferentially spaced apart from the next pair, by a distance equal to the center-to-center distance between adjacent tire body segments14in the circumferential direction of the tire body12.", "", "To assemble the illustrated tire, a user places each segment14individually onto the outer drum of the rim in order to seat the inner surface42of the segment14on the convex outer surface of the rim's cylindrical drum, and thereby insert the two fastener studs62bof that segment14through a respective pair of the holes in the outer drum of the rim. At this point, locknuts (not shown) are threaded onto the free ends of the fastener studs62band tightened up against the interior of the rim's outer drum, thereby securing the tire body segment14, and the respective cleat body16partially embedded therein, in place on the rim. This process is repeated until all the tire body segments14are secured in place, thereby collectively forming the overall tire body12that now fully spans around the rim to define a completed wheel that is ready for mounting to the wheel hub of a vehicle. With the female recessed area of each segment spanning the full radial dimension of the segment's side up to the outer surface40thereof, the male and female profiles of the segment sides form slidably matable tongues and grooves that allow radial sliding of each segment into place beside the previously installed segment.", "", "Each mounting plate60is fully embedded within the radially inner region thereof so as to be surrounded by the tire material on all sides. Accordingly, the entirety of the mounting plate60is spaced radially outward from the inner surface of the tire body segment14over the full axial length of the mounting plate, thereby maximizing the area over which the inner surface of the tire body segment is clamped to the rim.", "", "Assembled wheels of the type described above are installed on a working machine such as a skid steer, skidder, wheeled excavator, or other piece of wheeled working equipment that may be expected to work in muddy or other rough terrain (fields, forests, etc.), where the steel cleats will provide beneficial for traction compared to conventional rubber tires. At the same time, the embedding of the steel cleats in a rubber or other compressible tire body provides an improved ride quality over hard ground surfaces. The resiliently radially-compressible non-pneumatic tire body provides a degree of cushioning or suspension behind each individually cleat, whereby during rolling motion of the composite tire, the vehicle weight exerted downward on a ground-contacting cleat as it moves through its lowermost revolutionary path around the tire axis will compress the underlying area of the non-pneumatic tire body that resides between that cleat and the tire's rotational axis, thereby displacing this cleat upwardly toward the tire's rotational axis such that adjacent cleats on either side of this cleat come into contact with, or closer proximity to, the ground surface. In some embodiments, the compressibility of the tire body relative to the vehicle weight is selected such that, in rotation of the tire over a flat horizontal surface, three cleats will tend to contact the ground at a time, i.e. the centermost cleat most closely underlying the wheel's rotational axis and the two cleats adjacent to this centermost cleat. This not only improves ride quality, but reduces damage to the hard ground surface by distributing the vehicle weight over multiple cleats per wheel, instead of a single cleat per wheel. Sinking of the vehicle on soft terrain is also reduced due to this improved weight distribution.", "", "FIG.9shows a variant of the forgoing wheel in which each tire body segment14features small protuberances66at select areas of the outer surface thereof, particularly at areas thereof unoccupied by the cleats30, for example at open areas residing circumferentially between adjacent cleats at the outer circumference of the tire body. The protuberances provide the tire body with a tread pattern for improved traction on irregular terrain that may project into the open outer areas of the tire body between the cleats. With the protuberances66denoting raised areas of the tire body's outer circumference26where the tire body has greater radial thickness than the thinner remainder of the tire body at unraised areas of the outer circumference26, it will be appreciated that the cleats30are embedded in the radially thinner portions of the tire body. Likewise, even in the treadless tire body of the earlier figures, the cleated areas of the tire body are not of greater or increased thickness relative to the uncleated areas between the cleats.", "", "FIG.10illustrates another variant in which instead of each tire body segment14having a single U-shaped cleat body16integrally defining two cleats30, each tire body segment features two separate cleat units68each having a flat plate-shape defining a respective individual cleat30on either side of the segment's circumferential center. Instead of openings spanning radially through a central embedded span that integrally joins together two cleats of a U-shaped cleat body, each individual cleat unit68features openings34\u2032 spanning therethrough in the circumferential direction of the tire body so that rubber tire body material spanning through the cleat helps retain the cleat in place on the respective tire body segment14. The variant ofFIG.10features outer cavities70located nearer to the outer surface40of each segment in the radially outer region thereof, as this region need not be reserved to accommodate the tangentially oriented center span22of the U-shaped cleat bodies16in the other figures. Instead, each cleat unit68penetrates into the tire body at a location between a respective pair of the outer cavities70in the radially outer region of the segment.

This may be accomplished using insert molding techniques, where the rubber material of the tire segment14, in a melted or viscous state, is injected into a mold cavity in which the cleats have previously been placed in predetermined positions that will partially embed the cleat units68or cleat body16within the solidified rubber once hardened in place around the cleat units or cleat body, while leaving the non-embedded remainder of the cleat units or cleat body outside the mold cavity so as to reach outward from the solidified tire body and define the cleats. During the injection molding process, the cleats may be held in place in the mold using locating pins or magnetic retention. It will be appreciated that the number of cleats per segment may be reduced to one cleat per segment (or even to embodiments in which not all segments have a respective cleat). Alternatively, the number of cleats may be increased to more than two cleats per segment.

To optimize the bond of the mounting plates60within the rubber material of the finished tire segments, the mounting plates are first texturized by sandblasting and then coated with a bonding agent prior to placement of the mounting plates and threaded fasteners in the mold cavity. The bonding agent chemically bonds with the surrounding rubber during the moulding process, and the textured surfaces of the sandblasted mounting plates improve the bond at the metal/bonding-agent interface to maximize the strength of the overall bond between the plate and the rubber. In addition to the anti-rotation securement of the carriage bolt fasteners62by the matingly-shaped fastener holes in the mounting plates, each bolt fastener may also be permanently affixed to the respective mounting plate by tack welding. This also eases placement of the mounting plates and fasteners in the appropriate positions in the mold cavity by tack-welding each mounting plate and its respective fasteners into a pre-assembled unit before placement in the mold cavity.", "", "Like the mounting plates, the cleats are also roughened by sandblasting or other suitable surface texturing technique, and coated with a bonding agent prior to moulding in order to best anchor the cleats in place within the hardened rubber of the finished segments.", "", "While the cleated first embodiment features a segmented annular tire body with a central opening passing axially therethrough to accommodate a rim onto which the tire body is radially coupled by the above-described mounting elements60,62, cleats could likewise be embedded within a unitary molded tire body. In such embodiments, the unitary tire body may be of annular form having a central rim-accommodating opening therein, or may be of a non-annular form with an intact center in which axial bolt holes are provided for direct axial fastening of the tire to a wheel hub, thereby defining a rimless wheel.
