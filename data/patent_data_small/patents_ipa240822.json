Blending a silane coupling agent can improve dispersibility of the silica in the diene rubber.

The blended amount of the silane coupling agent is preferably 15 mass % or less, and more preferably from 3 mass % to 12 mass %, with respect to the blended amount of the silica.

Examples of the alkylsilane include monoalkyltrialkoxysilane, dialkyldialkoxysilane, and trialkylmonoalkoxysilane. Among these, alkyltrialkoxysilane is preferred, and alkyltriethoxy silane is more preferred.

Among these, from the perspective of miscibility with the diene rubber, an alkyl group having from 8 to 10 carbons is preferable, and an octyl group or nonyl group is even more preferable. The blended amount of the alkylsilane is preferably from 0.1 mass % to 20 mass %, and more preferably from 1 mass % to 5 mass %, with respect to the mass of the silica.

Examples of the fatty acid metal salt include various fatty acids such as caprylic acid, undecylenic acid, lauryl acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, alginic acid, lignoceric acid, cerotic acid, melissic acid, myristoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, and a salt of alkali metal such as lithium, sodium, and potassium. A single type or a combination of multiple types of fatty acid metal salts can be blended. The blended amount of the fatty acid metal salt is preferably from 2 mass % to 8 mass %, and more preferably from 3 mass % to 6 mass %, with respect to the mass of the silica. When the blended amount of the fatty acid metal salt is less than 2 mass %, rolling resistance deteriorates. When the blended amount of the fatty acid metal salt is more than 8 mass %, wet grip deteriorates.", "", "In the rubber composition according to an embodiment of the present technology, compounding agents other than those above may also be added. Examples of such other compounding agents include various compounding agents generally used in rubber compositions for tires, such as vulcanizing or crosslinking agents, vulcanization accelerators, anti-aging agents, liquid polymers, thermosetting resins, and thermoplastic resins.

The line of intersection l1thus follows the undulating form of the middle sipe zone12\u2033. As shown inFIG.7, the middle sipe zone12\u2033 is thus formed by shallow pyramid-shaped projections14, which are formed correspondingly alternately on the sipe walls12aand each have a rectangular, in particular square, base lying on the particular sipe wall12a(cf. the visualization inFIG.10), and depressions15which are situated opposite, and correspond with, the projections14.", "", "The profile of the line of intersection l1will hereinafter be discussed with the aid of an undulation baseline lb(FIG.9) that runs in the plane of symmetry F1.

The decrease in amplitude thus takes place in each case from the tread-inside end of a line-of-intersection portion l1\u2032, which is situated closer to the tread-inside sipe end12b, to the tread-outside end of said line-of-intersection portion l1\u2032, which is situated closer to the tread-outside sipe end12c. At the tread-inside end of that line-of-intersection portion l1\u2032 which is furthest to the inside of the tread, the amplitude has an amplitude value A1.
