When the air cavity10is in an incompletely inflated state, and the outer tire2is deformed under stress, the inner tube3can absorb most impact force to achieve a buffering effect, so that the impact force is prevented from being directly transmitted to the rim1, and hence the rim1is protected, the service life of the rim1and that of the tire are prolonged, therefore the novel tire structure of the present invention is particularly suitable for tires used in terrains like woodland and sand. The inner tube3is made of elastic porous material, the porous structure of the inner tube can be filled with gas, so that the air cavity10can be inflated normally, thus an amount of gas required to inflate the tire for normal use is ensured. Further, buffering effect can be achieved by the inner tube3even if the outer tire2has gas leakage, so that the tire can still be used for a period of time before reaching a maintenance point, and the potential safety hazard during the ride can be reduced. The inner tube3can still be ensured to be tightly attached to the inner wall of the air cavity10after the outer tire2is inflated and expanded thanks to the material and the size of the inner tube3, so that the functional stability is ensured.
