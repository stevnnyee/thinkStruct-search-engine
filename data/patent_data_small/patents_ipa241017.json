Accordingly, adjacent wheel sections110may be generally radially spaced apart by about 45\u00b0 in the expanded position of the wheel100as shown inFIG.5. In the example ofFIG.5, four wheel sections110, i.e., eight rims118, would be required to define a full circle or about 360\u00ba. Thus, if the wheel100is constructed with four wheel sections110, only one rim118, i.e., one contact point, contacts the ground at any instant.

Any number of wheel sections110may be provided for increasing or reducing contact points. For example, twenty wheel sections110would provide five contact points with the ground at any instant for the wheel100. In another example, twelve wheel sections110would provide three contact points with the ground.

In the example ofFIG.11, the projections120are shown to have a generally triangular cross-sectional shape and the grooves136are also shown to have a generally corresponding triangular cross-sectional shape. Furthermore, the size of the grooves136may generally correspond to the size of the projections120. For a tire104that is constructed from an elastic material such as rubber, the grooves136may be alternatively formed to be smaller than the projections120so that the grooves136elastically expand when receiving the projections120to provide a generally formfitting engagement with the projections120.

The angle between the wheel sections110in the expanded position that provides a sufficient number of contact points and generally evenly distributes the contact point locations on the wheel may be referred to herein as the expansion angle.

In the collapsed position of the wheel100, the pin144of each wheel section110is located near the first end150of the slot140of an adjacent wheel section110. As the wheel100is expanded, the pin144moves in the slot140from the first end150until the pin144contacts the second end152of the slot140.

The position of each slot140and pin144may be determined to allow expanding and collapsing of the wheel100as disclosed. In the example ofFIG.12, the first end150of the slots140is generally located along a center longitudinal axis154of the hub section112.
